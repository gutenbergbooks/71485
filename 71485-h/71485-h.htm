  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The “Introduction” in the succeeding pages, being
amply explanatory, but few prefatory words will suffice.
The object and intention of the work is manifest
and self-evident.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to extend to every female, whether wife, mother
or daughter, such information as will best qualify her
to judge of her own maladies, and, having ascertained
their existence, apply the proper remedies.</p>

<p class='c007'>From these pages she will learn the causes, the
symptoms and the remedies, for such complaints to
which she may be liable, the nature of which she may
not desire to impart to another.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether married or unmarried, she can, from these
pages, compare her own symptoms with those described,
and act in accordance with the mode of treatment
prescribed. She will thereby be exempt from those
doubts, perplexities and anxieties, which arise from
ignorance of her situation, or the causes which produce
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In short, the author sincerely believes that to the
female budding into womanhood,—to one about to become
a wife, or to the wife about becoming a mother,
as well as to every one already a wife and a mother,
as also to the female in the decline of years, in whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>nature contemplates an important change, the “Married
Woman’s Private Medical Companion” contains
instructions of such paramount importance, as to embrace
the present happiness and future welfare of
each.</p>

<p class='c007'>One word in conclusion. It is not pretended that
the concentration of the results of medical research
emanates from <i>one</i> author, for be he ever so versed in
medical science, he would come far, far short of so
herculean a task. It is, therefore, necessarily derived
from authors on medical and physiological sciences,
of great acquirements and distinguished celebrity.</p>

<p class='c007'>It hardly need be added that great labour has been
encountered in the preparation of a work of this nature,
as the most reliable and correct sources have been
availed of.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In introducing a subject of the nature treated of in
this volume we are perhaps treading upon interdicted
if not dangerous ground, for the world is not free from
those pseudo-moralists, who would check, and, if possible,
arrest the onward progress of medical and physiological
science, and compel all to trudge on in the
old beaten path, neither turning to the left nor the
right, much less to look forward, but cast their glance
backward. And although they behold every other
science marching with rapid strides to comparative
perfection:—what through the agency of steam and
iron rails, space as it were, annihilated; what but yesterday,
comparatively speaking, required weeks to perform,
a few hours now suffice; nay the lightning fluid
itself is made subservient to man’s powers of discovery
and ingenuity, transmitting intelligence from
distant points with the speed of thought:—yet, in
physiological and medical science, we are required
to be as an immovable rock, upon which the overwhelming
billows of physiological science and discovery
are to wash fruitlessly and in vain, to recede back
into the dark sea of ignorance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Truly, is it that in all that concerns man’s welfare
and woman’s happiness, we are to stand still, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>improvements and discoveries, in arts and sciences
connected with agricultural and mechanical pursuits,
are rushing by with the impetus of a torrent? Is it
that physiological and medical science has long since
reached that state of perfection that improvement and
discovery are impossible? Is it that preceding generations
had engrossed, in physiology, all the knowledge
that could be attained, and left nothing for succeeding
generations to attain? Is it that disease,
decrepitude, bodily suffering and stinted and imperfect
physical development among mankind has no longer
an existence? Is it that every woman enjoys the
full bloom, virgin freshness and beauty belonging to
the enjoyment of a perfect condition of health?
Is it that we no longer behold the deathly pale, sallow,
sickly female of sixteen or eighteen, in the last stage
of some chronic disease, prepared for the cold embrace
of death? Is it that for the married woman six
of the nine months of pregnancy is often a state of
suffering and anguish destructive to her health and
cutting off her days? Is it too, that it never happens
that she often has children only at the hazard of her
own life, and that of her offspring? Is it that children
are invariably born healthy and rugged, capable of
enduring the ordinary maladies to which infancy may
be subject, to be reared into robust and virtuous sons
and daughters? Is it that by far the greatest proportion
of those born, survive, instead of, at the least, two-thirds
being cut off in infancy? No, indeed, it is not
because of all this. It is because prejudice or ignorance
thinks that if men and women acquired the
knowledge whereby to improve their condition as social
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>moral beings, guard against disease, and preserve
their health, that <i>perhaps</i>, it might lead to immorality
and vice. This is ever the pretext to arrest the progress
of physiological discovery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Discoveries, then, so directly and intimately connected
with the personal individual happiness of every
man, woman, and child, are alone to see no progress;
without being met at the threshold with the senseless
and idle cry of “vice and immorality.” Thus
then, the sufferings, the pains, the anguish, which
have existed five hundred years ago, are to be irremediable
and endured in despite of any discoveries
<i>by which they can be prevented</i>. We must do nothing
to alleviate, or better still, to prevent, the sufferings
of the wife, daughter, or mother, because it was not
done five hundred years ago! Monstrously absurd as
is this reasoning, yet it is of this kind which the discoveries
introduced before the public in this work will
be met.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the subject is one which embraces our social
joys and comforts, the endearments of home and the
family fire-side, the health and well-being of wives,
mothers, and daughters, and cannot be retarded by
the cobwebs in its way, to stem its onward course.
No female, either married, or about to be married—no
wife about becoming a mother—no mother having
a daughter—no father who desires to prolong the
health, beauty, and vigor of his offspring—no husband
who has his own happiness, or the happiness of the
companion of his bosom at heart—no young man,
even, having a regard to his future welfare, should
be without this important little work. Here the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>wife, mother or daughter, can detect her own complaints,
trace them to their causes, and apply the remedy.
This is all important. For, how often does
the young female (because of a supposed delicacy),
suffer in health rather than impart her malady to
another, and especially to a medical man; and thus,
many diseases, which though trifling in their origin,
and at first easily removed, become seated and confirmed
in her constitution. How deplorable are the
consequences arising either from neglect or ignorance
in the treatment of females who are afflicted with a
stoppage, irregularity, or entire suppression of the
menses or monthly turns, from which spring a train
of diseases, which it would, in this place, be useless
to enumerate, but which make our wives and daughters
sickly, and our offspring short-lived.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is also important that the female should understand
the cause which might occasion a stoppage of
the menses to possess the information contained in this
work, by which it can be ascertained whether it may
not arise from pregnancy and thereby avoid that anxiety
of mind arising from an uncertainty as to her real
situation, alternately imagining the one or the other,
as her inclinations or fears may tend.</p>

<p class='c007'>During pregnancy, many a wife lives in almost
perpetual bodily ailment and suffering, which ought
and should be prevented, and would not in most cases
exist if this work is perused. Here important truths
and discoveries are revealed, which may be the means
of saving many an affectionate wife and fond mother
from a premature grave. How many females marry,
who, in becoming pregnant, jeopardize their life,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>would learn, if they perused these pages, of the discovery
by which <i>pregnancy can be prevented</i>, by means
at once safe, simple, certain, and healthy, and thus
many a victim would not fall a sacrifice to the Cæsarean
operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In respect, too, when a woman is threatened with
miscarriage or abortion it is important that the treatment,
either to prevent it, or, when that is impracticable,
to assist and expedite it, should be thoroughly understood,
and its treatment made clear and simple, that
no unnecessary alarm need be occasioned when it
occurs.</p>

<p class='c007'>So, too, in regard to the various diseases accompanying
and belonging to pregnancy, every woman
should know how to prevent the one and ameliorate
the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>And finally, the subject of unfruitfulness, sterility,
or barrenness, is here presented in a manner, which,
to some extent, demonstrates that in most cases it can
be cured, yet how many are pining in childless loneliness,
in utter despair of cure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such are some of the important topics treated of in
these pages, so intimately connected with every
woman’s peace and happiness, with which every woman
should be conversant, and yet how little informed
are most females with what concerns themselves,
their children, and their husbands so much.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>MENSTRUATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>One of the principal constitutional characteristics
of the female, is menstruation, or the
monthly evacuations peculiar to the sex.</p>

<p class='c007'>This important operation generally takes
place about the age of twelve or thirteen;
but varies through the world, either in degree
or frequency, both from constitution and climate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Women in the higher ranks of life, and
those of a delicate, nervous constitution, are
subject to sickness, headache, and pains in
the back and loins, during periodical evacuation.
Those of the lower rank, inured to
exercise and labor, and strangers to those refinements
which debilitate the system, and
interrupt the functions essential to the preservation
of health, are seldom observed to suffer
at these times, unless from general indisposition,
or a diseased state of the womb.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the discharge has become established
it recurs periodically while in health; and its
recurrence is so regular, that it can be calculated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>with great exactness. The usual
period of its visitations is from twenty-seven
to thirty days. As to the time of its continuance,
this is various in different women; but
it seldom continues longer than six days, or
less than three, and does not cease suddenly,
but in a gradual manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Its approach is generally preceded by certain
feelings of oppression or deviation from
the ordinary state of health, which warn the
individual of what is to happen. There is,
in particular, a sensation of fulness about the
lower part of the belly, and a relaxation
about the uterine system which can scarcely
be overlooked by the most heedless. The
appetite becomes delicate, the limbs tremble
and feel weak, the face becomes pale, and
there is a peculiar dark streak or shade under
the eyes; sometimes great restlessness, slight
fever, headache, heavy and dull pain in the
small of the back and bottom of the belly,
swelled and hardened breasts, &#38;c. All of
which are sometimes instantly relieved by a
trifling discharge from the vagina, and this
not necessarily colored. It must at the same
time be admitted, that in some few constitutions
these feelings are so inconsiderable as
to be little attended to; so that the woman
mixes in society as usual without any apparent
inconvenience.</p>

<p class='c007'>The period at which the menses make
their appearance, is various; it is much influenced
by constitution, climate and mode
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>of life. As a general rule, it takes place at
puberty, or at that period at which the female
is capable of propagating her species; and
this period varies as climate may differ.
They constantly, however, keep pace with
the development of the body; where this is
rapid, they will appear proportionably earlier;
where this process is slower, they will
appear later: but whenever the menses appear
as regular evacuations, they mark the
period of puberty: thus, in hot countries,
women commence to menstruate at eight or
nine years of age, and are not unfrequently
mothers at ten.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the more northern regions, as in Lapland,
&#38;c., this evacuation is generally delayed
until the female has attained her eighteenth
or nineteenth year: in the temperate
latitudes the average period will be found
from the fourteenth to the sixteenth year.
A difference, will, nevertheless, be found in
the women who may reside in cities, and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>those who dwell in the country of each respective
portion of the globe. It may also be
observed, that in cold countries, women continue
to menstruate for a longer period than
in warm; and as a general rule, it will be
found they are obnoxious to this discharge
double the period that elapses before it commences.
Thus, women who have not this
discharge until eighteen, will be found to
have it until beyond fifty; those who commence
at fourteen or fifteen, will leave off at
forty-five; those who begin so early as eight
or nine, will have it cease at twenty-five or
six.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>On the appearance of the menses, or
monthly turns, nature seems to perfect her
work, both as regards development and proportion:
it is the period of the most perfect
beauty of which the female is susceptible;
it is the one at which the moral changes are
not less remarkable than the physical; it is
a moment, of all others, the most replete with
consequences to the inexperienced and confiding
female.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>At this period a great variety of interesting
and curious phenomena present themselves:
the voice is found to change; the
neck and throat to increase in size, and to
become more symmetrical; the mammæ to
swell; the nipple to protrude; the chest to expand;
the eyes to acquire intelligence, and
increase of brilliancy; in a word, a new being,
almost, is created.</p>

<p class='c007'>The quantity of fluid expended at a menstruous
period differs in different individuals;
with girls who precociously menstruate, the
quantity is in general smaller, and the returns
less regular. Climate exerts an influence
upon the quantity discharged, as well as upon
the periods at which this evacuation shall
commence. Thus, in the equatorial and
more northern regions, it is less than in the
more temperate climates.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is of importance for women to know
that occasional irregularities are not always
the consequences of disease. Constitutions
vary as much in respect to the regular returns
of this discharge, as they do with regard
to their first appearance or final cessation.
Those in whom the change occurs
very early from vigor of constitution, require
little to be done for them; but in weak and
delicate habits, the non-appearance of this
evacuation is too often considered as the
cause, whereas it ought to be viewed as the
effect, of the state of the habit unpropitious
to its taking place. And, according to family
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>practice, under this false impression, warm
teas and forcing medicines are employed at
the approach of this disease, which have
often done much harm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nature is not so defective in her own
judgment as to require auxiliaries. Care
should be taken to improve the general state
of the health, by attention to diet, moderate
exercise, change of air, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some instances the menstrual discharge
does not make its appearance before the age
of seventeen or eighteen, and, nevertheless,
health is not in the least affected. The
mere want of evacuation at the ordinary
time, therefore, is not to be considered as
morbid, unless the system be evidently deranged
thereby. In many cases, however,
symptoms of disease appear which are evidently
connected with the defect of the
menses, and go off upon its discharge. The
treatment, in such cases, must be regulated
by the particular circumstances and constitution
of the individual. There is no remedy
adapted to every case of this kind; but an
open state of the bowels, and a due regulation
of the diet, together with moderate exercise,
are useful in every instance of this
complaint. Warm clothing, too, particularly
about the lower extremities, is of most
essential benefit. The occasional use of the
warm bath is pleasant and beneficial, especially
if the skin be dry and warm. As the
health improves, the cold bath will prove an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>auxiliary, if, after using it, the patient feels a
glow of heat and a greater degree of liveliness.
When the means ordinarily employed
have failed, marriage, or a change of climate,
has produced the wished-for effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some instances the evacuation is impeded
by a mechanical cause, that is an obstruction
of the passage to the womb. This occasionally
is met with, and the chief obstacle
to its speedy removal is the difficulty of ascertaining
its existence. The operation by
which it is completely remedied, is not more
painful nor formidable than blood-letting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fortunately, in most cases, the evacuation
takes place in due time, and the constitution
sustains no material or permanent injury. It
is, however, in every instance, proper to pay
particular attention to the system during the
continuance of the evacuation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stomach and bowels, at this period,
are very easily disordered, and therefore,
everything which is heavy or indigestible,
ought to be avoided. Some are hurt by eating
fruits or vegetables; others by taking
fermented liquor. In this respect experience
must enable each individual to judge for herself.
Exposure to cold, particularly getting
the feet wet, is hurtful, as it tends suddenly
to obstruct the discharge. The same effect
is likewise produced by violent passions of
the mind, which are also, at this time, peculiarly
apt to excite spasmodic affections, or
hysterical fits.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>It is, in general, a very proper rule not to
administer any very active medicines, at this
time, unless some violent symptom absolutely
requires them. Opiates, for instance, are,
in many cases, necessary to allay spasmodic
affections, or abate pain; and they are, in
such circumstances, uniformly safe. They
give speedy relief to hysterical feeling or
suffocation, or to spasm of the stomach or
bowels.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dancing, exposure to much heat, or making
any great or fatiguing exertion, are improper.
These causes may increase, to an
improper degree, the quantity of the evacuation,
and in certain circumstances may give
a disposition to a falling down of the womb.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>RETENTION OF THE MENSES.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Description.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The menstrual discharge is liable, from
many causes, to become obstructed at the
period when it ought to appear; when this
takes place it is attended with very painful
or serious effects; and, if nature is not assisted,
the health is impaired or the constitution
undermined, inducing consumption or
some other complaint.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Causes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The remote cause of this complaint is most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>frequently suppressed perspiration; and it
may arise, in part, from an inactive sedentary
life, and such habits as are peculiar to the
higher classes of society, particularly in cities
and towns. The proximate cause of it seems
to be a want of power in the system, arising
from inability to propel the blood into the
uterine vessels with sufficient force to open
their extremities and to allow a discharge of
blood from them.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Symptoms.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Heaviness, listlessness to motion, fatigue
on the least exercise, palpitation of the heart,
pains in the back, loins, and hips, flatulence,
acidities in the stomach and bowels, costiveness,
a preternatural appetite for chalk, lime,
and various other absorbents, together with
many other dyspeptic symptoms. As it advances
in its progress the face becomes pale,
and afterward assumes a yellowish hue, even
verging upon green, whence it has been called
green sickness; the lips lose their rosy
color; the eyes are encircled with a livid
areola; the whole body has an unhealthy
appearance, with every indication of a want
of power and energy in the constitution; the
feet are affected with swellings; the breathing
is much hurried by any great exertion of
the body; the pulse is quick, but small; and
the person is liable to a cough, and to many
of the symptoms of hysteria. Sometimes a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>great quantity of pale urine is discharged in
the morning, and not unfrequently hectic
fever attends. In cases of a more chronic
character there is a continued, though variable,
state of sallowness, yellowness, darkness,
or a wan, squalid, or sordid paleness of complexion,
or ring of darkness surrounding the
eyes, and extending perhaps a little toward
the temples and cheeks.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Treatment.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>As this disease proceeds from debility, it
is evident that the great object to be fulfilled
will be to give tone and energy to the system;
and if this debility has arisen from a
sedentary life, the patient must begin immediately
to exercise in the open air, and, if
practicable, to change her residence. The
tepid or warm bath should be used in preference
to the cold. The first medicine given
may be the pulverized <i>mandrake root</i>, combined
with a little <i>cream of tartar</i>. This, as
well as other medicines, should be taken
upon an empty stomach: after it has been
given, <i>motherwort</i>, <i>pennyroyal</i>, and other
herb teas may be freely drunk. After the
exhibition of the purgative, which may be
occasionally repeated, <i>gum aloes</i> may be
taken, combined in such a manner as to prevent
the piles. This medicine, from its action
upon the uterus through the medium of the
rectum, is very useful in retention of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>menses. <i>Emmenagogues</i>, or “forcing medicines,”
should not be used to bring on the
menses, except there be a struggle or effort
of nature to effect it, which may be known
by the periodical pains and pressing down
about the hips and loins. When this occurs
let the feet be bathed, and perspiration promoted,
by drinking freely of diluent teas,
such as <i>pennyroyal</i>, <i>motherwort</i>, and <i>garden
thyme</i>. Should considerable pains attend
the complaint, eight or ten grains of the <i>diaphoretic
powders</i> may be given, and <i>fomentations
of bitter herbs</i> applied over the region
of the womb. <i>Desomeaux’s Portuguese Pills</i>
are now recommended as the best specific,
especially if the disease proves obstinate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The female should be very careful not to
expose herself to the vicissitudes of the
weather, and not suffer the feet or clothes to
become wet: warm clothing must be worn,
and particularly flannel. For pain apply a
heated brick, covered, to the bowels.</p>

<p class='c007'>The diet should be light, nutritious, and
easy of digestion.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>SUPPRESSION OF THE MENSES.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Description.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>In this disease there is a partial or total
obstruction of the menses in women from
other causes than pregnancy and old age.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>The menses should be regular as to the
quantity and quality; that this discharge
should observe the monthly period, is essential
to health. When it is obstructed, nature
makes her efforts to obtain for it some other
outlet; if these efforts of nature fail, the
consequence may be, fever, pulmonic diseases,
spasmodic affections, hysteria, epilepsy,
mania, apoplexy, green sickness, according
to the general habit and disposition of the
patient. Any interruption occurring after the
menses have once been established in their
regular course, except when occasioned by
conception, is always to be considered as a
case of suppression. A constriction of the
extreme vessels, arising from accidental
events, such as cold, anxiety of mind, fear,
inactivity of body, irregularities of diet, putting
on damp clothes, the frequent use of
acids and other sedatives, &#38;c., is the cause
which evidently produces a suppression of
the menses. This shows the necessity for
certain cautions and attentions during the
discharge. In some few cases it appears as
a symptom of other diseases, and particularly
of general debility in the system, showing
a want of due action of the vessels. When
the menses have been suppressed for any
considerable length of time, it not unfrequently
happens that the blood which should have
passed off by the uterus, being determined
more copiously and forcibly to other parts,
gives rise to hemorrhages; hence it is frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>poured out from the nose, stomach,
lungs, and other parts, in such cases. At
first, however, febrile or inflammatory symptoms
appear, the pulse is hard and frequent,
the skin hot, and there is a severe pain in the
head, back, and loins. Besides, the patient
is likewise much troubled with costiveness,
colic pains, and dyspeptic and hysteric symptoms.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Treatment.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>It will be necessary, in the treatment of
this disease, to remove urgent symptoms if
they are present. If the patient is in severe
pain, give the <i>diaphoretic powders</i>,<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a> and at
the same time let a strong infusion of <i>garden
thyme</i> and <i>pennyroyal</i> be freely given. Immerse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the feet in warm lye water, and rub
well with coarse flannel. If relief is not
obtained in the course of an hour, or in a
very short time, a strong decoction of bitter
herbs should be thrown into a proper vessel,
and the patient steamed fifteen or twenty
times, as long as she is able to bear, or until
perspiration is produced; immediately after
which let her be put in bed, covered warm,
and the herbs be enclosed in flannel or muslin,
and applied to the lower part of the abdomen
or belly. This process will almost
immediately relieve the urgent symptoms.
After this our next object will be, to regulate
the menstrual discharge, by a proper course
of strengthening medicine; that recommended
under the head of <i>chlorosis</i>, or <i>a retention
of the menses</i>, may be taken with advantage.
Inasmuch as both proceed from debility, it is
evident that it must be removed in order to
effect a cure; and, therefore, that medicine
and treatment which strengthen and invigorate
the system, will invariably benefit the
patient. The skin, stomach, and intestines,
all seem concerned in the production of this
disease, and hence our attention should be
directed to a restoration of their proper offices:
the stomach and bowels should be
cleansed and stimulated to a healthy action;
perspiration must be promoted, and, in short,
every secretion and excretion of the system.
If the stomach is in a morbid condition, let
an emetic be occasionally given, and afterwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>a dose of <i>mandrake</i>; both of which
may be repeated as occasion requires. The
patient may then take the following tonic
bitters: Take prickly ash bark, two ounces;
wild cherry tree bark, two ounces; Seneca
snake-root, one ounce; tansy, one ounce;
gum socotrine aloes, half an ounce; devil’s
bit, two ounces: pulverize; to every two
ounces of the powder add half a pint of boiling
water and one quart of Holland gin, and
half a wineglassful taken three or four times a
day. This may be continued while it agrees
with the patient, or as long as benefit is derived.
About once a month there will generally be
felt more or less symptoms preceding a catamenial
discharge; considerable pain will
be felt through the lower part of the abdomen,
hips, and loins, showing that there is a
strong effort or struggle of nature to return
the menses. Our principal object, when this
occurs, should be, to aid her salutary efforts,
as directed in the Retention of the Menses.
The patient should sit over the steam of <i>bitter
herbs</i> for ten or fifteen minutes, retaining the
steam by means of a blanket, to concentrate
it upon the lower part of the body; at the
same time the feet may be bathed, and tansy
tea freely drunk. The abdomen should also
be fomented, as before directed. It will not
be necessary, however, to use these means,
except there is an obvious indication to return
the menses.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>It must be recollected that when the patient
labors under some other disease, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>is such debility that there is not superfluous
blood sufficient to keep up the menstrual discharge;
and in this case our attention must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>be directed to the primary affection, without
any regard to such symptoms; it is also very
necessary to bear in mind the fact, that the
menses are often suppressed from pregnancy.
By a proper attention, we can always discriminate
between a suppression of the
menses and pregnancy; and the principal
diagnostic symptom is, that in the former
complaint there is a pain or affection of the
head, attended with dizziness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>PAINFUL AND IMPERFECT MENSTRUATION.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Description.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Besides the two deviations from the usual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>course of nature already mentioned, there
sometimes occurs a third, viz. where menstruation,
although not wholly suppressed, is
nevertheless somewhat difficult, and accompanied
with severe pains in the back, loins,
and bottom of the belly. This disease is
owing to a weak action of the vessels of the
uterus, or spasm of its extreme vessels, and
is to be obviated by tonics, warm bathing,
both local and general, together with the
use of anodynes, which should be employed
as soon as the symptoms which denote its
approach are apparent. This complaint is a
common, and generally an extremely harassing,
affection. It may occur at every
period during the menstruation stage of life;
but it appears to be most common between
the twentieth and thirtieth years of age, and
in subjects of an irritable and sanguineous
temperament. In many instances severe
pains are experienced in the back, loins, and
lower part of the abdomen for five or six
hours previous to the appearance of the menses.
This, however, soon ceases, and an
immediate aggravation of the torturing pain
follows. Sometimes the catamenia begin to
flow moderately, with little or no previous
pains; but in an hour or two, they become
suddenly arrested, at the same time that violent
pains come on in the hips, side, loins,
back, and thighs, with a distressing sensation
of forcing or bearing down. Occasionally a
very slight menstrual discharge continues uninterruptedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>for three or four days, accompanied
throughout with extremely severe
pains in the abdomen; and in some rare instances
the catamenial evacuation, although
attended with great suffering, is sufficiently
copious and prolonged in its course, and may
even exceed the regular duration and quantity
of an ordinary healthy menstruation.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Treatment.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Since it is well known that a derangement
in the uterine functions must generally proceed
from a check of perspiration, astringing
the minute ends of the uterine vessels, or in
some manner deranging their functions, causing
debility, &#38;c., it will appear clear that our
first attention must be directed to the skin.
Cold appears to be the cause of the disease,
and heat seems to remove it; therefore, when
these periods of distress occur, let the patient
sit over a strong decoction of bitter herbs,
such as tansy, hoarhound, wormwood, catnip
and hops, while a blanket is thrown round
the waist of the patient to confine the steam
to the lower parts. After the diseased person
has been thus steamed and the feet
bathed, let her be put into a bed, warmly covered,
and diluent drinks given, such as tansy,
thyme, pennyroyal, &#38;c. At the same
time let fomentations of the same herbs,
enclosed in a flannel bag, be applied to the
abdomen, as before directed. This will produce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>perspiration and afford immediate relief;
and when these distressing symptoms
are removed, and the patient becomes comfortable,
a course of treatment must be adopted
to prevent a recurrence of these symptoms,
or to produce a natural flow of the
catamenial discharge; and similar to that
recommended under the preceding complaints.
Herbs may be freely drunk.</p>

<p class='c007'>A writer on this subject thus remarks,
“This case of painful menstruation deserves
particular attention, because it impairs the
health of patients by its present effects, and
seems to render them less prolific in future.
Dr. Fothergill has afforded relief to several
by the following process: Let the patient
have near her a few pills, consisting of opium,
gr. i. each, made soft with a little of any kind
of conserve. She is to take one of these
pills the moment the pain attending this discharge
comes on. A pill may be taken
every hour till the pain ceases: more than
two will seldom be required; yet they must
be taken in quantities sufficient to mitigate
the pain. Let the patient keep either in or
upon the bed, or at least in a recumbent
posture, drink moderately of any diluting
liquor, as herb teas, weak whey, or thin
broth. When the time is past, a course of
chalybeate bitters, in small doses, may be
continued, till within a few days of the
return; and the bowels should be kept open
with some proper laxative. This excruciating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>pain seems to be spasmodic, and to proceed
from the extreme irritability of the
uterine system.” The <i>diaphoretic powders</i>
will be found very useful. Diet and exercise
are important. A hot brick or salt, enclosed
in flannel wet with vinegar, and applied
to the bowels, soon relieves the pain.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>IMMODERATE FLOW OF THE MENSES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This alarming complaint may occur under
two different states of the constitution. In
the one, the woman is of full habit, and often
of a ruddy countenance. In the other, she is
pale, delicate, and easily fatigued.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Symptoms.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>In plethoric habits it is often preceded by
headache, giddiness, or difficult breathing,
and is afterwards attended with pain in the
back and loins, universal heat, and a frequent,
strong, and hard pulse. But when it arises
from general debility, or in consequence of a
laxity of the organ, paleness of the face,
chilliness, lassitude of the body, oppressed
breathing on the slightest effort, pains in the
back on remaining any length of time in an
erect posture, and coldness of the extremities,
together with a long train of nervous
complaints.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>
  <h3 class='c015'><i>Causes.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>A variety of causes may produce this
troublesome disease. Some of these are
general, such as a state of great weakness, or
of too much blood; others are local, such
as debility of the uterus, occasioned by
tedious labor or frequent miscarriages. It
may also be produced by accidental circumstances
determining the blood more copiously
and forcibly into the uterine vessels, as violent
exercise in dancing, much straining at
stool from great costiveness, contusion on the
belly, excess in venery, or strong passions of
the mind, particularly at the menstrual period.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Treatment.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>In the management of this disease we have
two objects: first, to moderate the discharge
and procure present security; and, secondly,
to prevent a return.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first thing to be done when the
hemorrhage is sudden or profuse, is instantly
to remove the clothing which may occasion
the least interruption to the free circulation
of the blood, and to put the patient to bed,
lightly covered with clothes. So long as this
discharge continues, it is of importance to
keep her in a recumbent posture, as cool as
possible, and perfectly at rest, both in body
and mind. Cloths, dipped in cold vinegar
and water, and renewed as often as they become
warm. These cold applications have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>a powerful effect in restraining uterine
hemorrhage, and ought never to be omitted
where the discharge of blood is profuse.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the patient be of a full habit, attended
with severe pain in the head or back, and
febrile symptoms, it will be proper to give
the antimonial, or febrifuge powders, or
mixture.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The state of the belly must be attended
to. It can be kept gently open by the cathartic
mixture, sulphur, or any mild laxative
medicine. Stimulating purgatives or clysters,
under such circumstances, are improper,
from their tendency to increase the discharge.</p>

<p class='c007'>When no symptoms indicating an increased
action in the vessels of the womb are present,
astringent medicines should be employed.
And, in cases where the discharges
have not continued long, and the strength
not much impaired, it is often sufficient to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>arrest the disease by giving fifteen or twenty
drops of elixir vitriol, or six or eight grains
of alum dissolved in a glass of cold water
every hour; or, what is preferable, alum
whey, sweetened to the taste, in doses of a
small cupful, as often as the stomach will
receive it. But, if the discharge be obstinate,
we should have recourse to pills of
sugar of lead and opium.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In no instance which has come under my
knowledge, where the hemorrhage was in
consequence of a laxity of the uterine vessels,
have these pills failed in producing the desired
effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>In those cases where the hemorrhage is
profuse, or of long continuance, and resists
the means already pointed out, it will be
proper to inject into the uterus from a gill to
half a pint of a strong decoction of oak bark,
in which one or two drachms of alum have
been dissolved, or as much of the saturated
solution of alum in water, in order to constringe
and strengthen the vessels of the
womb. This may be repeated twice or
thrice a day, according to circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>When symptoms of an increased action in
the vessels of the womb are observable, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>tincture of foxglove, in doses of twenty
drops every four hours, constitutes the best
remedy.</p>

<p class='c007'>When there is reason to suppose the hemorrhage
proceeds from a scirrhous or ulcerated
state of the womb, all that can be done,
is to afford temporary relief by giving opium
in large doses. Indeed, opiates may be
given with advantage in every case where
there is considerable pain or anxiety, and the
patient much exhausted. Under these circumstances,
from one to two teaspoonfuls
of laudanum, or from two to four grains of
opium, according to the urgency of the case,
will be useful not only in giving a check to
the discharge, but also in preserving the
strength, and abating nervous irritation. In
most cases it is preferable to give opium in
the form of injections to allay the spasmodic
pains of the womb; and, when administered
in this way, clysters of thin starch or gruel,
in each of which two teaspoonfuls of laudanum
are added, should be given every two
hours until relief be obtained. (<i>See Abortion
and Flooding.</i>)</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Regimen.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The diet, at the time of excessive discharge,
must be light and cool. The drink
must always be cold, as ice-water, lemonade,
or tamarind beverage. Port wine, in such
cases, is too frequently resorted to, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>uniformly does harm by increasing the circulation.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Prevention.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>To prevent a recurrence of the attack in
those who are subject to it, the patient must
necessarily avoid the causes by which it has
been produced.</p>

<p class='c007'>When it is evident that the discharge is in
consequence of a full habit, it will be proper
to reduce the system by living sparingly, by
keeping the bowels rather in a laxative state,
and by rising early, and taking through the
day regular but frequent exercise; and, after
the plethora is removed, by strengthening the
vessels which have been over-distended, by
the use of the cold bath.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a greater number of cases, however,
we meet with a delicate constitution and
spare habit, with pale countenance: this
state requires the use of sea bathing or the
shower bath, and the vessels of the womb
are particularly strengthened by pouring
cold water daily on the back and loins.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be advisable to use a generous nutritive
diet, with wine, and to have recourse
to some of the tonic medicines, as advised
under the head of obstructed menses, to
strengthen the system generally. At the
same time the bowels must be attended to,
and invigorating exercise taken daily; whilst
on the other hand, fatigue, and especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>exposure to relaxing heat, must be carefully
avoided.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>DECLINE OF THE MENSES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The nearer a woman approaches her
forty-fifth year (<i>cæteris paribus</i>), will be the
risk of some irregularity in the menses; and
as this period is more frequently the one at
which any latent disease of the uterus shows
itself, it is always looked forward to with
much anxiety by women. Indeed, so replete
is this time with horrors to many, that
we may very justly suspect apprehension
to be the cause of some of the distressing
symptoms, which sometimes accompany this
interesting process of the human uterus.</p>

<p class='c007'>Delicate women, and especially those who
have lived idly, have this period of life arrive
earlier than those of a contrary constitution,
and opposite habits. We have already
noticed, in our section on Suppression,
that this change sometimes takes place at a
very early period of life, and this without
leaving any injurious consequences behind
it; and, on the other hand, we find many
cases on record, where this discharge had
continued with regularity to a much longer
period than the ordinary one. Gardien mentions
a case which fell under his own notice,
where this evacuation continued with great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>exactness, until beyond the seventy-fifth
year; others, still more uncommon, are mentioned
by various writers.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This change is sometimes effected so silently,
that the woman scarcely notices her
altered condition; at others, its approach is
so gradual, as not to attract observation, until
the diminished quantity gives warning
that it is about to take its leave for ever;
while, again, the irregularity, both in period
and quantity, may be such, as justly to give
alarm, as well as to produce the most serious
danger.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, as a general rule, it may be observed,
that when the woman arrives at about her
forty-fifth year, she finds her menses to become
irregular, both in the quantity of fluid
evacuated, and in the periods they observe;
being sometimes in advance, and at others,
not appearing until long after the accustomed
time. The woman also finds some alteration
has taken place in her general health; she
becomes pale, debilitated, and nervous;
arising, however, for the most part, from the
too frequent returns of this discharge, or its
too great abundance.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this time, also, the woman sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>becomes the victim of a strange illusion,
should the menses not have returned for
several periods; for she now supposes herself
to be pregnant, as her abdomen enlarges,
as do the mammæ; her appetite becomes
capricious, or she has strange longings, &#38;c.,
the whole of the rational signs of this condition
being present, in her imagination, even
to the motion of the child. This delusion is
most common to women who marry late in
life, and who are very desirous of offspring.
Now the breasts lose their intumescency;
the morning sickness vanishes; the swelling
of the abdomen subsides; the imagined stirrings
of the fœtus cease, or the sensation becomes
so unequivocal as to satisfy that it
arises from the movement of wind; and, to
put everything beyond hope, the menses return
in overwhelming quantity. It is highly
proper, that practitioners, and especially the
younger part of them, should be put upon
their guard in respect to this condition of the
patient, and not too easily yield credence to
all her wishes may dictate, or absolutely to
treat as an impossibility, a circumstance of
which there is occasionally an example.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems that the apprehensions of this
period of life have arisen mainly from the
notions entertained of the final cause of the
menses; namely, that it gives vent to peccant
humours. But females should be made to
know, that all this is purely the theory of the
vulgar; as the menstrual blood is formed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>from the general mass; and, consequently,
if that be pure, the other will be; therefore,
the idea is altogether ill-founded. But unfortunately,
whenever this discharge is less
abundant than usual, the most serious fears
are entertained, that there will be a retention
of a portion, which will cause disease, either
in the uterus itself, or in some other part of
the body; hence, a diminished menstruous
secretion is always more alarming to the
female, than an unusual flow. But it may be
well to remark, that there is a great difference
between the cessation of this discharge,
and the suppression of it. In the one instance,
it is an event which nature has designed
should take place, and is effected
altogether by arrangements of the system
itself; and, of course, one of its natural
processes: in a word, as much so as its commencement;
but the suppression, from some
morbid agency, is in direct opposition to the
intentions of nature, and will, of course, be
followed by some baleful consequence, if it
continue beyond a certain period.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vulgar error, that “women at this
period of life are always in danger,” is replete
with mischief to the suffering sex; and
I feel it a duty to declare, that they are not
necessarily more obnoxious to disease at this,
than at any other period of their existence.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>That they are sometimes liable to a disease
at this time; and that disease one of the
most terrible in the long list of human infirmities,
I admit; but must, nevertheless, insist
that <i>Cancer</i> (the disease to which I
allude, and the one so much dreaded) is
more rare in the uterus than in certain other
portions of the body; for instance, the
mammæ; and, perhaps, I am within the
truth, when I say, that there are three instances
of the latter for one of the former.
If latent dispositions to disease, either in the
uterus or other parts, become active about
this period of life, it is not because the declining
menses excite them; but because the
disease is slow in developing itself, and is,
perhaps, kept in check for a long time, by the
menstrual discharge serving as an important
evacuation; especially when the uterus may
be the seat of the complaint. In such instances,
the foundation of the disease was
laid, perhaps, at the time when the menses
were the most perfect, as regards period and
quantity; consequently, they could have had
no agency in its production; but, on the contrary,
from its frequently relieving the engorgement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>of the vessels, served to keep it in
subjection for a long time; not as a specific
discharge, but as a mere depletion; or, in
other words, that if an equal quantity of
blood could have been by any other means
as certainly abstracted from the uterus, the
same favorable result would have followed.
Coincidences in the human system are so
common, that they are frequently mistaken
for cause and effect; hence the cessation of
the menstrual discharge, and the appearance
of scirrhi and cancers, are considered as
cause and effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this period of life, nothing will so effectually
secure the woman against injuries which
may arise from the irregularities of the menstrual
discharge, as a well-regulated regimen.
By regimen, in this place, we would wish to
be understood, not only eating and drinking,
but exercise of both body and mind, including
the proper government of the passions;
in a word, everything which relates to both
moral and physical existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>A well-ordered course of exercise in the
open air in well-selected weather, and great
simplicity of diet, is of the utmost importance
to the female at this period of life, and should
never be neglected, if it be possible to indulge
in them. By these means, the nervous, muscular,
vascular, and lymphatic systems are
all preserved more certainly in equilibrium
with each other, since they are the best calculated
to ensure a reciprocation of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>respective offices; and, consequently, to
maintain that condition of the system, termed
health. Hence, the justness of the remark,
that the women who live in the country, and
who exercise freely in the open air; who
have fulfilled their duties scrupulously as
mothers, by suckling their children, agreeably
to the views of nature; who do not
goad their systems by over-stimulating food
and drinks; who do not relax their bodies
by too long indulgence in bed, have but little
suffering at this period.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this it will follow, that a milk and
vegetable diet, together with pure water
as a drink; regular exercise, not carried to
fatigue; keeping the bowels well open, by
well-selected food, as the fruits of the season
in proper quantities: the bran bread if necessary;
but not by medicine, unless absolutely
required; governing the temper; restraining
the passions, as well mental as animal, will
largely contribute to the safety and comfort
of this period. All that we have just recommended,
is calculated to place the system in
a condition by which it shall preserve its
various forces; have its irritability diminished;
its sensibility moderated; and pretty
certainly prevent that condition of the blood-vessels,
most decidedly unfriendly to the
general health at this time, called plethora.
And, though last, not least in fair estimation,
is an attention to cleanliness. The external
organs should be washed with lukewarm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>water at least twice a day, and the whole
body once a week, by going into a lukewarm
bath. In using the bath, care should be
taken to come out of it as soon as the purposes
of cleanliness are answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our next concern is with the derangement
of the discharge at or about the period of
cessation: this will consist, 1st, in a diminution
of the proper quantity; and, 2dly, in an
excess of it. As regards the first, we have
already said enough when treating of the
suppression of the menses; and, with respect
to the second, it must be treated according to
the rules prescribed for the management of
hemorrhage from the uterus from any other
cause, that is, first, to diminish the quantity
discharging; secondly, to prevent an excessive
return.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>
  <h2 class='c005'><span class='large'>CONCEPTION;</span><br> <span class='small'>OR,</span><br> PREGNANCY.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c013'>CONCEPTION.</h3>

<p class='c014'>In order to procreate the human species,
there is a periodical discharge of blood from
the vagina of every female, termed the catamenia,
or menses. The secretion of this
fluid commences at that period of life termed
puberty, which occurs at different ages, according
to the climate. In some latitudes it
commences as early as eight or ten, and in
others not until fifteen. As soon as conception
or pregnancy commences, this discharge
ceases, and goes to support the fœtus, or the
child.</p>

<p class='c007'>The manner in which conception takes
place has ever been a fruitful subject of inquiry,
but we are unable to account for this
change precisely. It is, however, pretty
evident that the semen of the male is introduced
into the uterus, while the semen of the
female is discharged from the ovaria by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>means of the Fallopian tubes, the fimbricated
extremity of which closely embraces that
organ.</p>

<p class='c007'>These tubes, by a kind of peristaltic motion
similar to the intestines, convey the semen of
the female into the uterus, where it unites
with the semen of the male; and it is these
united fluids which constitute the rudiment
of the fœtus, and which often give to the
child the appearance and dispositions of their
parents. Sometimes one trait is inherited,
sometimes another; at other times a new
compound or character is formed (like a
chemical union), which does not partake of
the nature of either of the former.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>OF THE MODE BY WHICH PREGNANCY MAY BE DETERMINED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There are certain signs which a female is
taught to regard as essential evidences of
pregnancy and it is supposed by most, if
not by all women, that their presence is absolutely
necessary to the existence of this
state. In reference to one or two of these
signs, this is far from the fact; for they are
not unfrequently absent, although pregnancy
exist, and the remainder may be present, although
pregnancy be absent. Many a female,
I am confident, has, from this very circumstance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>experienced much difficulty in attaining
certainty as to her state, and suffered
months of anxiety and doubt. This has
arisen from a want of those clear notions, and
that precise information, which a question so
important demands.</p>

<p class='c007'>The object of this chapter is to remove
this difficulty, by presenting a short account
of those symptoms of conception which the
female may herself observe, and to point out
to what extent they may be relied on. It
will be necessary to notice only <i>four</i> of the
signs or symptoms of pregnancy, and they
may be considered in the order in which they
usually arise; that is, ceasing to be unwell;
morning sickness; shooting pains through,
enlargement of, and other changes of the
breast; and, lastly, quickening.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Ceasing to be unwell.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The first symptom of pregnancy is the
omission of that monthly return, which, in
female phraseology, would be described as
“ceasing to be unwell;” and it may be adopted
as a general rule, that, in a healthy woman,
whose menstruation has been established, and
continued regular, and who is not nursing,
“Conception is followed by a suppression of
the menstrual discharge at the next return of
its period.” Thus, a female may have been
pregnant a week or two already; but she is
not aware of it till that period of the month
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>arrives when she is accustomed to menstruate,
and then, when she expects to be unwell,
she finds that she is not so.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now this symptom, as a general rule, admits
of four exceptions:—</p>

<p class='c007'>First. A young female shall never have
menstruated, and yet conceive.</p>

<p class='c007'>Secondly. A mother shall conceive while
she is nursing, and not menstruating.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thirdly. A female shall conceive, and
yet be unwell during the first three, four, or
more months of pregnancy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fourthly, and lastly. Occasional conception
takes place late in life, after menstruation
has apparently ceased for ever.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>First Exception.</i>—Many cases are on record
proving this point. I have met with
only two cases; one quite a girl, not having
arrived at her seventeenth year, and yet was
in her sixth month of pregnancy when she
applied for a letter for the Finsbury Midwifery
Institution; the other was in her nineteenth
year. Menstruation was, subsequent
to confinement, established in the first; with
the result of the latter, I am not acquainted.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Although pregnancy under such circumstances
is not of frequent occurrence, still it
does now and then take place. A knowledge
of the fact may therefore prove useful.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Second Exception.</i>—It is scarcely necessary
to advert to the well known fact that a
woman may conceive while she is nursing,
without any previous return of the monthly
discharge, except to expose the popular error,
“that a female will not become pregnant during
lactation.” This is very far from being
the case. Poor women are much in the habit
of nursing their infants eighteen months, two
years, and even two years and a half, in order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>to protect themselves, as they imagine,
from becoming pregnant; and many a poor
creature have I seen with exhausted frame
and disordered general health, arising from
protracted nursing, pursued alone from this
mistaken notion.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have large opportunities of investigating
this, as well as the several points touched
upon in this chapter. On an average, between
forty and fifty poor women call upon
me every month, with midwifery letters for
attendance in their confinement: and the result
of my inquiries upon the present question
has led me to believe, that more than
one third of these women have conceived at
least once while nursing, and very many of
them oftener.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. M——, ætat. 30, married six years.
Became pregnant three months after her marriage.
Having suckled this child for more
than two years, became pregnant a second
time. This last died in three weeks, and immediately
after she proved pregnant for a
third time. The third child she brought this
morning (being out of health), and assured
me that she had not seen anything since she
first conceived, that is, three months after her
marriage, and six years from the present time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. W——, ætat. 25, married five years.
Has not been unwell since she first fell in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>family way; is now pregnant with a third
child, having hitherto fallen pregnant while
nursing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many other cases illustrative of this fact I
might assert, but these suffice to prove the
exception.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><i>Third Exception.</i>—That a female should
become pregnant, and yet be unwell during
the first three, four, or more months of pregnancy,
may appear an extraordinary statement;
but it is a fact, that the menstrual discharge
sometimes continues in its usual regularity
for two, three, or more months after
conception, and without any dangerous consequences.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been asserted, as an objection, that
this discharge is not truly menstruation; but
the discussion of that question does not concern
us here. We have only to consider,
whether there does not frequently, during
pregnancy, take place a discharge, so closely
resembling menstruation in its periods, quantity,
duration, and appearance, that neither
the female herself nor her medical adviser
shall be able to detect any difference between
them; and of this I have no doubt.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may occur <i>once</i> only after conception,
either in diminished quantity or more profuse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>than usual. It may thus give rise to miscalculation
as to the expected time of confinement.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may continue in its usual regularity for
<i>two</i> or <i>three months</i>. The following instance
of a patient I attended illustrates the fact of
its going on to the period of quickening:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. R——, ætat. 27, married eight years.
Was first unwell when eighteen years of age,
and continued to be so regularly until she
became pregnant, two years from the time
of her marriage. She suckled her first child
for eleven months; soon after she became
unwell, and continued so until she quickened
with her second child; a circumstance which
she had not the slightest suspicion of, for
there was no perceptible difference either in
the quantity or appearance of the monthly
discharge. During the remaining months of
gestation she did not see anything; she afterwards
suckled her little one for ten months;
and then was obliged to wean the child, having
an attack of the cholera. She continued
from this time regular for two years; but
meeting with a fall, much to her surprise,
two or three days after, miscarried of a four
months’ child. She is now pregnant again, having
been regular every month till she quickened,
and expects to be confined, Feb. 1836.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this case then, the female was unwell in
two pregnancies till the period of quickening;
and in the other for four months, when
miscarriage took place from accident.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>And lastly, it may occur through the <i>whole</i>
period of pregnancy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. F—— is now pregnant for the third
time. In her first pregnancy the monthly
returns appeared for three periods, regular
as to time, and in quantity and appearance
as heretofore. During the second child-bearing,
at every month till confinement. During
the third—her present pregnancy—for three
months only. This patient is always unwell
while nursing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. J——, now in her eighth pregnancy.
Was unwell every month throughout the first
six pregnancies; but the quantity always
slightly diminished. In the seventh, the same
circumstances occurred; but premature labour
was this time induced, between the sixth
and seventh months, by a fall. During the
present pregnancy she has not seen anything.
Is always unwell while suckling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. P—— is in her fourth pregnancy.
In the first three was unwell, at her regular
periods, to the time of confinement. The
discharge the same in quantity, but rather
lighter appearance. Has been unwell in her
pregnancy every month up to the present
time.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>The following case proves how important
it is that this fact should be generally known;
for up to a very late period, some medical
men have even denied the possibility of this
occurrence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case I refer to was that of a young
lady, privately married, the gradual enlargement
of whose abdomen was decided by her
medical attendant to arise from dropsy; for,
although she had most of the symptoms of
pregnancy, and the medical man was aware
she had been married eight months, still, as
<i>she continued to menstruate</i>, he declared it
impossible that she could be pregnant. Tapping
was proposed; and, except that her
general health suffered much at this time, the
operation would have been performed. The
delay saved the patient such unfortunate and
mistaken treatment—it might have proved
fatal in its results—and she shortly gave birth
to a living and healthy male child.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fourth exception.</i>—That women late in
life have conceived after menstruation had
apparently ceased for ever, the following cases
prove:—</p>

<p class='c007'>In September, 1834, I was called to the
assistance of a female in labour in her forty-ninth
year. She had not been pregnant for
twelve years, and supposed she had ceased
to menstruate two years previous to that
time. She did well, and never afterward
saw anything.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. B——, ætat. 39. Has been married
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>eighteen years, commenced to be unwell very
early in life. Has had three children; the
last pregnancy seven years since. Is now
again pregnant, her menses having left her
sixteen weeks prior to conception; before
which, she had been very irregular, and supposed
she had ceased to be unwell for ever.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other cases of a similar nature are on record.
There can be no doubt they are authentic;
but at the same time it must be
acknowledged that a female is not unlikely to
be deceived, by the irregularity which attends
the returns of this discharge, late in life. It
so happens, too, that just before the change
of life takes place, there appears in the constitution
of some females a great disposition
to pregnancy; so that many who have ceased
to bear children for years, or have been
hitherto barren through the whole of their
married existence, at this time, to the surprise
of their friends and themselves, become pregnant.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>A knowledge of these facts must be useful,
as they will tend to allay apprehension at
what might be supposed disease, both by the
mother and by the hitherto childless woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>A female must not forget, however, that
she may mistake her condition, and that such
mistakes are not at all unlikely to arise from
the circumstance that the symptoms which
naturally accompany the <i>cessation</i> of menstruation,
much resemble those of pregnancy.
She passes over the menstrual period;—she
is struck with this. Other symptoms are soon
manifested; the size increases—the breasts
even become swollen and painful—the stomach
disordered, and the appetite capricious;—flatulence
collects in the intestines; and
while on this account the size still increases,
the air moving about the bowels gives an inward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>sensation which is mistaken by the female
for the plunging of the child. Time
alone, or the investigation of the medical attendant,
detects the mistake; and the symptoms
are then to be easily removed by the
exhibition of carminative and purgative medicines,
the use of active exercise, and bandaging
the distended abdomen.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be remembered, also, that <i>suppression</i>
of the monthly return may arise from a
variety of causes, altogether independent of
conception. Every female is aware, that
exposure to cold, just before the expected period,
is a frequent cause. Different forms of
disease, hardship, or mental emotions, may
produce the same result. It does not follow,
therefore, because a woman ceases to menstruate,
she <i>must</i> be pregnant; which naturally
presents this inquiry: what dependence,
then, is to be placed upon the omission of
menstruation as a symptom or sign of pregnancy?</p>

<p class='c007'>When a female ceases to be unwell, and
experiences other symptoms of pregnancy,
she must consider her situation as yet uncertain,
because these signs are common to disease
as well as pregnancy. But if toward
the third month, while the suppression continues,
she recovers her health, and if her
appetite and colour return, she needs no better
proof of pregnancy; for under other circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>her health would remain impaired,
and even become worse.<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Morning Sickness.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Soon after conception, the stomach often
becomes affected with what is called “morning
sickness.” On first awaking, the female
feels as well as usual, but on rising from her
bed qualmishness begins, and perhaps while
in the act of dressing, retching takes place.</p>

<p class='c007'>This symptom may occur almost immediately
after conception; but it most frequently
commences for the first time between
two or three weeks after. Now and then it
is experienced only the last six weeks or two
months of pregnancy, when it is attended,
generally, with much distress and discomfort.
And lastly, it is not unfrequently absent altogether.</p>

<p class='c007'>It continues, more or less, during the first
half of pregnancy, and subsides about the
time when the movements of the child begin
to be felt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Irritability of the stomach, however, may
arise from a variety of causes totally independent
of pregnancy, and connected with
disease or disordered function. Of what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>avail, then, it will be asked, is this symptom
as a sign of pregnancy? It is so far
available:—</p>

<p class='c007'>The nausea and vomiting of pregnancy are
not accompanied by any other symptom of
ill health; but, on the contrary, the patient
feels as well as ever in other respects, and
perchance takes her meals with as much relish
as formerly; but while doing so, or immediately
after, she feels suddenly sick, and
has hardly time to retire, when she rejects
the whole contents of her stomach, and very
shortly after is quite well again. Not so with
sickness arising from disease, or disordered
condition of the stomach.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Shooting pains through—enlargement of—and other changes of the breast.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>When two months of pregnancy have
been completed, an uneasy sensation of throbbing
and stretching fulness is experienced, accompanied
with tingling about the middle of
the breasts, centring in the nipple. A sensible
alteration in their appearance soon follows:
they grow larger and more firm. The nipple
becomes more prominent, and the circle
around its base altered in color and structure,
constituting what is called “the areola.”
And, as pregnancy advances, milk is secreted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The period of gestation at which these
changes may occur, as well as the degree in
which they become manifested, varies very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>much. Sometimes, with the exception of the
secretion of the milk, they are recognised
very soon after conception;—in other instances,
particularly in females of a weakly
and delicate constitution, they are hardly
perceptible until pregnancy is far advanced,
or even drawing towards its termination.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Enlargement of the Breast.</i>—The changes
in the <i>form</i> and <i>size</i> of the breast may be the
result of causes unconnected with pregnancy.
They may enlarge in consequence of marriage,
from the individual becoming stout and
fat, or from accidental suppression of the monthly
return. There are, however, these
differences: enlargement from pregnancy
may in general be distinguished from that
produced merely from fat, by the greater
firmness of the breast, and its knotty uneven
feeling—it is heavier; and the tension and
enlargement from suppressed menstruation,
by its subsiding in two or three days, whereas
that caused by pregnancy continues to increase.
Nevertheless, the dependence which
may be placed upon the enlargement of the
breast only, as an evidence of pregnancy, is
not very great, and considered alone, but a
doubtful sign.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Nipple.</i>—Not so the changes which
take place in the nipple, and around its base.
These alterations, if present, are of the utmost
value, as an evidence of pregnancy. The
changes referred to are these:—</p>

<p class='c007'>About the sixth or seventh week after conception
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>has taken place, if the nipple be examined,
it will be found becoming turgid and
prominent, and a circle forming around its
base, of a colour deeper in its shade than
rose or flesh-colour, slightly tinged with a
yellowish or brownish hue, and here and
there upon its surface will be seen little prominent
points, from about ten to twenty in
number. In the progress of the next six or
seven weeks, these changes are fully developed;
the nipple becoming more prominent and
turgid than ever: the circle around it of
larger dimensions, of an extent of about an
inch or an inch and a half; the skin being
soft, bedewed with a slight degree of moisture,
frequently staining the linen in contact with
it; the little prominences of larger size, from
the sixteenth to the twelfth of an inch perhaps;
and the colour of the whole very much
deepened, but always modified by the complexion
of the individual, being darker in
persons with dark hair, dark eyes, and sallow
skins, than in those of fair hair, light-coloured
eyes, and delicate complexions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such are the essential characteristics of the
true areola, the result of pregnancy, and, I
believe, of that condition only.</p>

<p class='c007'>This, then, is a most valuable sign; but,
unfortunately, it is frequently absent; and
how often it is present, although I have examined
many hundred cases for it, I cannot
determine, as unfortunately no note was
made upon this point. It should also be observed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>that both in dark and fair women, the
change of colour, without the other appearances,
may be present, and yet pregnancy
exist; and I have also seen frequently the
dark circle alone, where pregnancy did not
exist; but I never saw an instance where
these prominences were truly developed, without
the presence of pregnancy.</p>

<p class='c007'>This fact has been more particularly noticed
of late years by an eminent physician-accoucheur,
and the attention of the author has,
in consequence, been much directed to it;
and, as a striking illustration of its truth, he
may mention, that, called upon very recently
to visit one of the Institution patients, the
third day after her delivery, and having occasion
to examine the breast, I pointed out to
the gentleman in attendance the presence of
these little prominences around the base of
the nipple; upon which the patient, to my
great surprise, immediately observed, “Ah,
sir, I always know when I am pregnant by
them, for they appear about ten days or a
fortnight after its occurrence, and subsequent
to delivery diminish gradually, as my milk
leaves me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It has occurred to me during the past year
to be consulted in five cases of doubtful pregnancy.
In <i>two</i> of them, circumstances forbade
the probability of its occurrence; but
in both the true areola was distinctly and
fully developed. It decided my opinion;
and the result proved its correctness: both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>became mothers. <i>Two others</i> had made
themselves patients of the Lying-in-Institution,
having obtained letters for attendance from
governors of the charity, and upon which
was marked, by their own calculation, the
month of their expected confinement. But
I was led to believe, from observing two or
three symptoms, that pregnancy did not
exist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their cases were examined, and at last the
breast; in both the true areola was wanting:
the review of symptoms decided all doubts.
Had, however, the true areola been present
in either, it would at once have reversed, instead
of confirming my first suspicions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>fifth</i> was pregnant, but the true areola
was wanting; and I was obliged to refer to
those signs which can alone be recognised by
a medical man.</p>

<p class='c007'>The absence, then, of this sign, except
in combination with other circumstances,
proves nothing, but, if present, I believe it
conclusive.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Presence of Milk.</i>—With regard to
the presence of milk in the breasts, as this
is a symptom which may arise, and does very
generally, in the latter months of gestation
alone, when the existence of pregnancy has
been long determined, it is only mentioned
here to refute the popular error, that “the
presence of milk in the breasts is an infallible
proof of pregnancy.” It is no such thing;
and many well-recorded instances could be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>brought forward to prove the possibility of its
formation under circumstances totally independent
of pregnancy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Belloc speaks of a servant girl, who being
obliged to have sleeping with her an infant
who was being weaned, and which by its
crying disturbed her rest, bethought her of
giving it her breast to appease its clamour;
and the result was, that in a short time she
had milk enough to satisfy the child.<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The following case is related by Mr.
George Semple: Mrs. B——, wife of John
Breward, Simpson Green, near Idle, aged
forty-nine, the mother of nine children, the
youngest of whom is twelve years old, lost
a daughter-in-law about a year ago, who
died in about a fortnight after giving birth
to her first child. On her death, Mrs. B.
took charge of the infant, a little puny sickly
baby. The child was so fretful and uneasy,
that Mrs. B. after many sleepless nights, was
induced to permit the child to take her nipple
into its mouth. In the course of from
thirty to thirty-six hours she felt very unwell;
her breasts became extremely painful, considerably
increased in size, and soon after, to
her utter astonishment, milk was secreted,
and poured forth in the same abundance as
on former occasions, after the birth of her
own children. The child, now a year old, is
a fine, thriving, healthy girl, and only a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>days ago I saw her eagerly engaged in obtaining
an apparently abundant supply of
healthy nourishment, from the same fountain
which, nearly twenty years ago, poured forth
its resources for the support of her father.”<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>
  <h3 class='c015'><i>Quickening.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>There is only one other symptom which I
think it useful to notice, that is quickening;
by which is meant, the first sensation experienced
by the mother of the <i>life</i> of the child
within her womb.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first time this motion of the child occurs,
the sensation is like that of the fluttering
of a bird within her, and so sudden that
she frequently faints, or falls into an hysterical
paroxysm. A day or two passes by
when it recurs. It afterwards increases both
in frequency and degree, until the movements
of the child are fully recognised.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is proper that a female should be informed
that the <i>period</i> when quickening takes
place is very uncertain; for an impression is
popularly prevalent that it always occurs
<i>exactly</i> at the end of four calendar months
and a half. This is not the case; it varies
in different women, and in the same women
during different pregnancies, as the following
one or two instances will prove:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. F——. Quickened with her first
child at four months: quickened with the second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>at fourteen weeks: and is now in her
third pregnancy, and reckons from the fourteenth
week again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. B——. Has had seven children, and
with all felt the motion of the child for the
first time at the third month.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Mc M——. Has been several times
pregnant; seldom feels movements of the
child at all until the sixth month, and not
strongly till the eighth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The annexed table of the periods of quickening
of seventy cases taken in the order
in which they have been entered in the author’s
note-book, will forcibly stamp the truth
of these opinions:</p>

</table>

<p class='c007'>In a few of these cases, for the sake of
convenience I have used round numbers,
when two or three days before or after was
the exact time; and for the sake of correctness,
have omitted several cases, in which
there was the slightest doubt in the patient’s
mind of the exact time.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears from this table, that this symptom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>takes place more frequently between the
twelfth and sixteenth week, than before or after
these periods; and that subsequent to the
4½ and the expiration of the sixth month, it
may occur in the proportion of more than
one case out of every five.—Before the third
month, quickening seldom arises.</p>

<p class='c007'>This symptom may not be felt by the
mother at all, and yet pregnancy exist. This
is rare, but the fact is confirmed by many
writers; and I have met during the last
seven years with two instances, and in both
the mothers gave birth to living and healthy
children.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now comes the question, how far this
symptom is of value, as a sign of the pregnant
state?</p>

<p class='c007'>If it has been experienced in former pregnancies,
it is invaluable, for I believe it is not
to be mistaken. If it is a first pregnancy
and doubtful, it removes all obscurity, provided
the sensation grows stronger and stronger,
until the movements of the child are distinctly
felt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Four only of the symptoms of pregnancy
have been noticed, because the remainder
are not recognisable, except by the accoucheur,
although to him of the greatest value
when pregnancy is complicated and doubtful
from the presence of disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nature of these symptoms has been
described as plainly, and yet as briefly, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>possible, because of the importance of their
being clearly understood by married women.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have also endeavored to point out their
real value as evidence of pregnancy—how
they are sometimes absent in patients who
are pregnant, and some of them present in
those who are not so—because of the doubt
and obscurity which arise from these variations.</p>

<p class='c007'>And lastly, in bringing these observations
to a conclusion, I venture to say, that if the
married female will only take the trouble to
make herself familiar with this little detail,
she will not regret the time as lost or misspent,
because it will generally guide her
aright, and I trust save her many moments of
anxiety and discomfort.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='small'>ON THE</span><br> <span class='large'>DISEASES OF PREGNANCY,</span><br> <span class='small'>AND HINTS FOR THEIR</span><br> PREVENTION AND RELIEF.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In describing the diseases which are incident
to the whole period of pregnancy, my
design is to take a general popular survey of
the subject. I wish simply to communicate
that kind of information, which every married
and well-educated woman should certainly
possess, and can usefully employ. To
advance further than this, to those points upon
which the assistance of the medical adviser
ought to be sought, would be on every account
improper, and productive rather of
evil than of good.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no organ in the body, with the
exception of the stomach, that exercises a
more extensive control over the female system
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>than the womb. Hence, when in the
condition of pregnancy, it affects, directly or
indirectly, various parts of that system. The
effects of pregnancy, however, vary much
according to the constitution of the female.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes a very salutary change is produced,
so that the individual enjoys better
health during gestation than before. The
delicate and frequent-ailing girl, for instance,—the
propriety of whose marrying was a
matter of doubt among her friends—becoming
pregnant, instead of realizing the apprehensions
and fears of those most dear to her,
will sometimes acquire new life and vigor
from the altered circumstances of her condition.
On the other hand, speaking generally,
it is sometimes the case that harassing and
painful symptoms will arise. These are designated
the “diseases of pregnancy.”</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Morning Sickness.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Nausea or vomiting, is one of the most
common and distressing affections of pregnancy.
It is chiefly troublesome in the earlier
months of gestation, continuing until the
period of quickening, when it decreases or
ceases spontaneously;—or it does not occur
until the latter months of pregnancy, when it
subsides only upon delivery. I shall consider
these states separately; and—</p>

<p class='c007'><i>First</i>, of sickness during the <i>earlier</i> months.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>This arises solely from sympathy with the
newly commenced action, and irritable condition
of the womb. This is evident from
the fact, that, as the novelty of the pregnant
state ceases, and the stomach becomes accustomed
to it, the sickness subsides gradually,
and is rarely troublesome afterwards.</p>

<p class='c007'>It occasionally commences immediately
after conception; and it is a remarkable fact,
that a pregnant woman scarcely ever feels
sick, until she first gets upon her feet in the
morning. Hence it is called the “morning
sickness.” She awakes refreshed and well,
arises from her bed, and while dressing begins
to feel qualmish. At the breakfast table
she has no appetite, or if she takes anything,
is shortly obliged to leave for her dressing-room,
where she returns what she has
taken; or, if she has been unable to take anything,
ejects a fluid, limpid, thin and watery;
and if the vomiting increases in severity, bile
is thrown up at the same time. After the
lapse of three or four hours, she feels quite
well again, and by dinner time sits down
with an appetite to her meal.</p>

<p class='c007'>If there is merely nausea or vomiting
<i>without the presence of bile</i>, it is evident that
it arises solely from irritability of the stomach,
and is not connected with a disordered
condition of the digestive organs, which latter
circumstance is not unfrequently the
case. The best means that can be employed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>to relieve this irritable state will be found in
a draught taken twice a day for several days,
composed of fifteen grains of magnesia, one
drachm of tincture of columba, and an ounce
and a half of distilled peppermint water.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Medicine sometimes is hardly called for;
and I have known a tumbler of warm chamomile
tea, or even warm water only, taken
immediately after nausea was felt, by inducing
immediate vomiting, tranquillize the disturbed
stomach, and thus abridge the morning
attack. It is sometimes attended with advantage
to take the chamomile tea before
the female rises from her bed. I advised
this with the most marked success very lately
in the case of a lady who was very much
reduced by the morning sickness. It had
continued for several weeks, and with so
much violence and straining, as to cause
blood to be ejected with the fluid. In less
than one week, when all other means had
previously failed, the above suggestion was
successful.</p>

<p class='c007'>It frequently happens that the acidity is
very great, in which case fifteen or twenty
grains of magnesia should be taken in a
wine-glass of milk<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a>—or, if it is preferred, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>small tumbler of soda water; but the latter
must not be persevered in for any great
length of time, as it will then become injurious.
The presence of acidity, however, is
sometimes so difficult to overcome by alkalies,
that these medicines must be given up,
and acid remedies employed. Lemonade
may first be taken, but lemon juice and water
is still better.</p>

<p class='c007'>The state of the bowels must not be forgotten,
and if any of the latter remedies are
resorted to, the most marked benefit will be
derived from a gentle dose of Epsom or
Cheltenham salts every second morning, if so
often necessary.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The diet in such a case must also be carefully
attended to; but as this point will be
referred to more particularly presently, it is
only necessary now to say that the quantity
of food taken must bear some proportion to
the slightly diminished powers of the digestive
functions, and that it will be well, when the
sickness is very obstinate and distressing, to
take no food at all for several hours after
rising. If, after a few hours, the mouth is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>much parched, it may be moistened with a
little broth, or weak beef-tea; but let nothing
more be taken for five or six hours, and it is
most probable that the sickness which has
resisted all other means, will thus be relieved.</p>

<p class='c007'>If this irritable state of the stomach is connected
with a <i>disordered condition</i> of the <i>digestive
organs</i>, the sickness will be accompanied
with the presence of bile in the matter
vomited, a furred tongue, confined or irregular
action of the bowels, and occasionally
with what is termed “a sick headache.”
These symptoms are to be relieved by medicines
which thoroughly clear out the bowels,
allay the irritability of the stomach, and afterwards
by those which restore tone to both.
But it is to be observed that the following
directions are only intended to apply to
those simple cases, in which, whether necessary
or not, no one ever thinks of consulting
their medical adviser, and for which it is certainly
desirable that they should have some
judicious directions, rather than be left entirely
without them. If these symptoms become
at all aggravated, it is requisite that
they should make immediate application for
professional advice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bowels will need in the first instance a
draught composed of infusion of senna and
Epsom salts—the common “black draught,”—with
half a drachm of the tincture of henbane
in addition. This, with five grains of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>blue pill, most probably effects the object desired;
the bowels will be well purged, and
the tongue become clean.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next thing is to allay the irritability
of the stomach, which is to be accomplished
by the means already pointed out—the
effervescing draught of soda, magnesia, chamomile
tea, &#38;c.; but in connexion with this,
two or three grains of the purified extract
of aloes, with an equal quantity of the extract
of henbane, must be taken two or three times
a week, at bedtime. This will keep the
tongue still clean, and the bowels in order.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a little time, the sickness having
subsided, tonic medicines may be used: and
a fourth part of the following mixture, taken
three times a day, will, under the present
circumstances, be the best means of restoring
the tone of the stomach and bowels: sulphate
of quinine, six grains; diluted sulphuric
acid, half a drachm; infusion of columba,
five ounces and a half; simple syrup, half an
ounce.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having pointed out the means for mitigating
sickness in the early months, there only
remains one additional suggestion to make,
and it is, that all the remedies for relief detailed
may, in some cases, fail. The sickness
continues most obstinate; every time
the female takes food, or even sometimes
when abstaining from it, she vomits; and at
last, from this excessive irritability and long-continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>violent action of the stomach,
symptoms threatening miscarriage will manifest
themselves.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a> There is generally in such
a case, pain and a sensation of tension about
the pit of the stomach, increased after every
attack of sickness. If symptoms of miscarriage
are not present, the application of nine
or twelve leeches to the stomach, and pieces
of soft linen rag well soaked with laudanum,
constantly applied and renewed, will give the
most decided relief. If, however, there is
pain in the loins and hips, increasing in frequency
and power, becoming at last slightly
bearing down, I strongly advise the patient
to consult her medical adviser, as the loss of
a little blood from the arm, perfect rest in the
recumbent position, and other directions
which he alone can give, will, in such a case,
be absolutely necessary, and I may add, if
perseveringly acted up to by the patient
herself, be certainly followed by success.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Secondly</i>, of sickness coming on at the
<i>conclusion</i> of pregnancy.</p>

<p class='c007'>This arises from the distended state of the
womb affecting mechanically, by its pressure,
the coats of the stomach, and certain
parts of its neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>This form of vomiting but rarely occurs;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>for do not let me be supposed to refer to the
sickness which sometimes immediately precedes,
and generally accompanies, the early
part of labour. I am speaking of that irritability
of the stomach which may arise about
the sixth, seventh, or eighth month, and from
which the female has been entirely free during
the previous months of gestation, and
now producing vomiting of an exceedingly
troublesome form.</p>

<p class='c007'>A lady suffering from sickness thus late in
pregnancy, ought to seek medical advice at
once. From this cause, if severe, premature
labour might be brought on, and judicious
medical treatment is always decidedly necessary
to mitigate this form of sickness. The
patient must lose a little blood, she must keep
strictly to her sofa, and the bowels ought to
be gently acted upon by small doses of Cheltenham
or Epsom salts. A grain of the extract
of opium may be given to allay the
irritability at night, and cloths dipped in laudanum
frequently applied to the pit of the
stomach.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all forms of sickness arising from
pregnancy as its cause, the diet must be
light, mild, and nutritious, taken in moderate
quantities of three or four meals a day. It
should consist of mild animal food, boiled or
roasted. Chicken, white game boiled, mutton
or beef roasted, are the viands most nutritious
and easily digested. Stale pure
bread untoasted, or pilot bread, mealy potatoes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>or well-boiled rice, in moderate quantities,
may be taken with animal food for dinner.
A glass of port wine with warm water
at the conclusion of the meal, is the best kind
of beverage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Advantage has often been derived from
always taking brown bread, and Jamaica
sugar in the morning’s coffee. The healthy
operation of the bowels has thus been
promoted; although a system of regular exercise
by walking, apportioned to the strength,
and not continued so long as to fatigue, will
generally effect this purpose, while at the
same time it gives tone to the general health.
Fatigue of body is sedulously to be avoided.
Slow and moderate walks, exercise in an
open carriage (if the patient has sufficient
strength), should be taken daily between
breakfast and dinner; always avoiding to sit
down to the latter meal tired, and, therefore,
probably, with a blunted appetite.<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Heartburn.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>This is a very distressing symptom, and
occurs early after conception; sometimes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>however, not till after the fourth month; and
occasionally is absent altogether. It is produced
by an acid forming on the stomach,
which rises into the throat, and, from the sensation
it occasions, is called <i>heartburn</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a very common complaint of pregnancy,
and every female knows that she finds
relief by taking a little magnesia or chalk, or
lime-water and milk, with the occasional use
of magnesia; but, although these means
generally mitigate this symptom, occasionally
it is very severe and almost intractable, and
they fail. Under such circumstances, a
draught composed of 15 grains of magnesia,
10 drops of the solution of the subcarbonate
of ammonia, and 1½ ounce of mint or peppermint water,
taken three times a day, and
continued for three or four days, will remove the
complaint.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the bowels are confined, as is frequently
the case, mild doses of Epsom or Cheltenham
salts will be the best aperients. The use of
these must be regulated by circumstances,—taken
every second, third, or fourth day;
that is, resorted to with sufficient frequency
and perseverance to guard against
costiveness.<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>diet</i> must also, in every case, be strictly
attended to, and regulated upon the plan already
stated.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>
  <h3 class='c015'><i>Costiveness.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>A costive state of bowels is one of the most
common and, at the same time, troublesome
of the diseases of pregnancy. It arises partly
from the increased activity which is going
on in the womb, and which induces a sluggish
condition of the bowels, and partly from
the pressure of the now enlarged and expanded
womb on the bowels themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>A confined state of bowels is the frequent
source of many serious evils; it therefore behoves
the female to be vigilant and guard
against it.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>First</i>,—Because, as before stated, pregnancy
itself predisposes to constipation.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Secondly</i>,—Because it is much more easily
prevented than removed, when, after several
days’ confinement, an accumulation of hardened
fæces has collected in the lower bowel.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Thirdly</i>,—Because such an accumulation
may give rise to inflammation of the bowel
itself, and, in the earlier months of pregnancy,
to miscarriage; and,</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Lastly</i>,—Because, if a female falls into labor
with her intestinal canal so loaded, it will
of itself be sufficient to render, what would
otherwise have been a quick, easy, and safe
labor, a long, painful, and difficult one; and
may be the cause also of very serious and
alarming symptoms some forty or eight-and-forty
hours after her labor is over.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first and leading symptom of this affection
is a costive or more consistent state than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>usual of the fæcal excretions, with a less
frequent call for evacuation than is customary
with the individual when in health. If
this is not attended to, and several days, perhaps
a week, pass by without the bowels
being relieved at all, pain in the head, a foul
tongue, and an increased degree of fulness
and tension of the abdomen, are experienced.
These symptoms are followed,
in all probability, by thin watery evacuations,
attended with pain, weight, and
pressure about the lower bowel; they become
frequent; and the female at last, finding that
the bowels are not only open again, but even
loose, takes chalk mixture. She is not aware
that this very looseness is nothing more than
increased secretion of the lining membrane
of the bowel, caused by the pressure of the
accumulated mass of hardened fæces, which
it passes and leaves unmoved. The chalk
mixture relieves the irritation upon which the
looseness depends, but the disease is not removed,
and, instead of its being a case simply
of costiveness, it has now become one of constipation;
an accumulation of hardened stool
is distending and irritating, by its pressure, the
lower bowel and the womb, and the serious
consequences before enumerated may follow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very often have I been consulted by a female
far advanced in pregnancy for what she
supposed mere looseness of bowels, which
has already been found to originate under
circumstances like these. It is of the highest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>importance that the patient should endeavor
to guard against such a result; and without
doubt she may avoid it, and regulate her
bowels with great comfort to herself, throughout
the whole period of pregnancy, if she
will only use the means.</p>

<p class='c007'>In pointing out a plan to accomplish this
desirable object, the first prescription I have
to offer is by far the most valuable,—“prevention
is more easy than cure.”<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a> If the
bowels are sluggish to-day,—that is to say,
if they are not as freely relieved as usual,—and
you do not assist them by medicine, depend
upon it, to-morrow they will be confined,
and there will be no relief at all. If,
then, the bowels, are <i>disposed</i> to be costive, I
would recommend one large tablespoonful
of castor oil—if it does not nauseate the stomach,—and
advise that the dose be repeated
in four hours, if the desired effect has not
been produced, or a wine-glass of beaume de
vie at night; and early the next morning,
before leaving the dressing-room, let the
lavement be used, the injection consisting
merely of a pint of blood-warm water;—or
the following pills will be found useful to be
kept in the patient’s bedroom:—Two scruples
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>of the compound extract of colocynth
and one of the extract of henbane divided
into twelve pills. Two or three of these
may be taken at bedtime, when the bowels
have not been, during the day, satisfactorily
relieved. These are always ready in the
bedroom, and, as they generally answer the
object efficiently, and with comfort to the
patient, are the most convenient form of
aperient.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will now and then happen, however, that
the female has let the day slip. When this
is the case, in combination with medicine, the
use of the lavement is desirable. Medicine
alone will not answer the purpose, unless it
be taken in doses so strong as will not only
move the bowels but irritate them too. With
the exhibition of the warm water, mild aperients
never fail. Females, generally, are
averse to the use of the lavement, and it is a
prejudice which is most deeply to be regretted.
I have known purgative medicines so often
resorted to, and, in time, so increased in power
and quantity, because they began to lose
their effect, that, by their continual irritation,
disease of the lower bowel has been produced,
and death has, at last, been the consequence.
If, then, the bowels have been
one or two days confined, the lavement in
the morning will render much less medicine
necessary, and frequently have an effect
when medicine alone would not. Many ladies
use the warm water every second or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>third morning, during the latter weeks of
pregnancy; and by this means they regulate
their bowels—which would otherwise be
confined—with great comfort to themselves,
and need no medicine at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will only add one word, in conclusion,
upon this subject. Let it be remembered,
that if the bowels have been confined several
days, and diarrhœa comes on, that this is not
a natural relief, but the effect of irritation,
caused by the presence of a loaded state of
the lower bowel, which must be quickly removed
by the medical attendant, or it may
give rise to some one of those serious evils
already enumerated.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Diarrhœa.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>An affection very opposite to that which
has just been discussed, may occur during
pregnancy. We have seen how diarrhœa
may arise as a symptom of costiveness. It
will manifest itself, however, independently
of such a cause. The intestines may participate
in the irregularity of the womb, and,
their vermicular action becoming morbidly
increased, diarrhœa is the consequence. It is
a disease which varies very much in different
individuals, and may clearly be divided into
two kinds.</p>

<p class='c007'>One, in which the motions are more loose
and frequent than in health, but not otherwise
much altered in their appearance. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>tongue is clean, or only slightly white, and
the appetite is pretty good. No medicine is
required here; a careful diet will correct the
evil.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>In the other case</i>, the stools are liquid,
dark-coloured, and very offensive, accompanied
with a coated tongue, bad taste, offensive
breath, loss of appetite, and more or less
disorder of the digestive organs. In these
latter circumstances, your medical adviser
should be consulted; in case you do not
see him, I have found at first the following
draught, given every three or four hours,
very useful—rhubarb, eight grains; ipecacuanha,
one grain; dill water, one ounce.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the tongue cleans, the stool becomes
more natural, a wine-glass, three times a
day, of some bitter infusion, such as cascarilla,
orange peel, or gentian, may be taken
with advantage. If the diarrhœa continues
for any length of time, it is always wise to
have the surface of the body kept warm with
flannel; and this is best accomplished by a
flannel roller bound gently round the abdomen.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in either form of this disease, whatever
remedies are proposed, there is one
mode of treatment applicable to both, and
which is the most important of all; a proper
system of <i>diet</i>. The food must be sparing
in quantity, of the mildest quality, and such
as to leave, after the process of digestion, as
little excrementitious matter as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>In a recent attack, the <i>first</i> day, the patient
should only take mild drinks, containing a
small quantity of unirritating nutriment;
such as barley water, or arrowroot made
with water. Irish moss will be found palatable.
During the <i>next</i> day or <i>two</i> the same
diet must be continued, but may be given in
larger quantity, and of greater strength.
Tapioca, sago, and rice-gruel might be added
to the list. When the irritation is somewhat
allayed, on the <i>third</i> or <i>fourth</i> day, perhaps,
broth may be taken; but no solid food of any
kind, least of all solid animal food, until the
disease is removed or greatly allayed. As
soon as this is the case, a small quantity of
the lightest animal food may be taken; such
as the animal jellies, made from calves’ head
or feet, chicken with well-boiled rice, white
game boiled, roast mutton and beef may follow;
but lamb and veal for the future should
be avoided.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be observed, that in some cases,
where the diarrhœa has been of long standing,
a <i>drier</i> diet is best, the liquid food
appearing to keep up the disease. Rice well
boiled, and merely moistened with a little
broth, is the best and one of the most desirable
articles of diet in such cases.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Piles.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pregnant women are very subject to piles.
Both with costiveness and diarrhœa they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>a frequent attendant, but particularly with
the former. They will usually disappear, if
they are slight, as soon as the bowels are
restored to a healthy action; but they may
not, and then will give rise to great suffering.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pregnant woman recognises piles under
two forms: 1, where they exist as little
tumours within or without the bowel, becoming,
very soon after their exclusion, more
solid and firm, unless they early break and
bleed; and 2, where they present, without
the bowel, a tumour, large in circumference,
separable in lobes, altogether like a piece of
sponge coloured, and bleeding occasionally
from the surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of all the <i>causes</i> which operate in the production
of piles, habitual constipation is the
most frequent. The excrementitious matter
is delayed in the bowel, becomes hard and
knotty, and a source of great irritation: this
irritation induces a determination of blood to
the part, and the gradual dilatation of its
vessels takes place as a consequence, which
eventually forms the tumours known under
the appellation of <i>piles</i>. Now, as in
pregnancy there is a greater disposition to
costiveness than at any other time, and as
piles are a consequence of this disordered
function, so this disease is much more prevalent
during the pregnant state than at any
other period; another argument, and a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>powerful one, why costiveness should be diligently
guarded against.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>symptoms</i> of this complaint are well
known. There will be weight, heat, and a
sense of fulness about the lower bowel, a
frequent desire both to relieve the bowels
and bladder; all of which symptoms are removed
for a time if a discharge of blood
takes place.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the piles be without the bowel, they are
constantly irritated by the friction of the
parts in the ordinary motion and erect position
of the body, and that to a painful degree
during the period of the evacuation of
the bowels. If exercise be taken in a carriage,
the pain is much aggravated; and if
the irritation produce inflammation, the piles
will become swollen, red or purple, and excessively
painful.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>treatment</i> of this disease, when it
occurs during pregnancy, is two-fold—general
and local. We must remove the <i>cause</i>
by such means as excite a brisker action of
the bowels; and our choice of aperients
must be directed to those which act efficiently
but mildly, and without irritating the lower
bowel itself.<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a> Next to small and repeated
doses of castor oil—say a tablespoonful,—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>most desirable form of aperient that can
be employed is the confection of senna, that
is, lenitive electuary, combined with sulphur
and magnesia. Of the following form, a
dessert-spoonful or more should be taken, at
first, twice daily:—Confection of senna, two
ounces; flowers of sulphur, one ounce; carbonate
of magnesia, two drachms and a half.
In conjunction with this medicine, much benefit
may be derived by the injection of half
a pint of warm or cold water—whichever
soothes most—as a lavement; but it must be
administered very cautiously, to avoid irritating
the parts with the pipe of the instrument.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is important that medicine, in frequent
use, should be so taken as to act upon the
bowels in the evening only; for if the bowels
are acted upon in the morning, the patient
being obliged to move about all day, will
suffer considerable distress and local
irritation; whereas, if the bowels are not evacuated
till the evening, the horizontal position,
and the perfect rest of a long night, will obviate
all inconvenience.</p>

<p class='c007'>Great assistance may be afforded in the
cure, and also in alleviating pain, by external
applications to the tumours themselves. If,
however, the piles are swollen and inflamed,
and the pain experienced great, half
a dozen leeches, or from half a dozen to a
dozen, should be first applied in their immediate
neighbourhood, the parts fomented, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>then warm bread and water poultices renewed
every three hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>These remedies will afford very considerable
relief; and, when the inflamed state is
subdued, an ointment must be applied to the
tumours and around them night and morning,
composed of two drachms of powdered
galls, half a drachm of camphor, and two
ounces of lard; or composed of one drachm
of powdered black hellebore root, rubbed
down in one ounce of lard. The latter preparation
will, for some time after its application,
give much pain, but proportionate relief
will follow.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>diet</i> must be sparing in quantity, mild
in quality, and such as to leave after its digestion,
as little to pass through the bowels
as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>I would beg attention to one more observation
on this subject. The removal of piles
by operation, during the pregnant state, is
perhaps never justifiable. Let the patient,
therefore, consult her medical attendant in
time, and not by a false delicacy expose herself
to an evil which it is her duty to endeavour
to prevent.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Enlargement of the Veins of the Legs.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>This is a frequent, but not very troublesome,
accompaniment of the latter months
of pregnancy. It arises in some degree from
the pressure of the womb upon the large
venous trunks, impeding to a certain extent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>the free flow of blood through them. It is
frequently remarked in pregnant women who
have passed a certain age; but it is particularly
unusual for it to happen, in the case of
young women, even during a series of repeated
pregnancies.</p>

<p class='c007'>When first observed, <i>if the veins have not
become knotty</i>,—that is, having little lumps
or swellings in their course up the leg,—the
only means which it is necessary to employ,
is the application of a muslin or cotton bandage,—six
yards in length, and as wide as
three fingers—from the sole of the foot up to
the knee, and sufficiently firm to give support
to the venous trunks. This bandage well
and equally applied to the limb, with a little
aperient medicine twice a week, and the recumbent
position for two or three hours in
the middle of the day, will cure this form of
the affection.</p>

<p class='c007'>When after a time the <i>veins, more and more
distended, have become lengthened, tortuous,
coiled up or knotty</i>, the female begins to experience
a sense of heaviness, numbness, and
sometimes very acute wandering pain,
through the whole of the affected limb. In
a more advanced stage, in proportion as the
knotty tumours increase, the limb becomes
generally swollen.</p>

<p class='c007'>This form of the disease calls for much
care and patience on the part of the sufferer.
The legs should be strapped, from ankle to
knee, with strips of adhesive plaster, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>over this a muslin or cotton bandage must be
applied with a moderate degree of tightness,
and kept wet with goulard water. In conjunction
with these local appliances, it is
sometimes wise to lose a few ounces of blood
from the arm, and always necessary to take
every other night a gentle aperient, to live
upon a spare diet, and for some days to keep
the horizontal posture. An elastic laced
stocking made for the purpose may be afterward
worn, and will be found at once a sufficient
support to the limb, and a source of
great comfort to the wearer.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Swelling of the Feet and Legs.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>In the course of pregnancy, during the
latter months particularly, the feet and legs
frequently become much enlarged. It is
partly owing to the pressure of the womb,
but sometimes apparently independent of it.
It is first observed towards night, about the
ankles; by degrees the swelling rises higher,
and the legs may become of a very large
size. The female suffering from this complaint,
always goes to bed with legs much
swollen, but towards morning her face swells,
and the enlargement of the legs disappears
to a greater or less extent, returning, however,
as the day advances.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes this disease is very trifling in
its character, and in ordinary cases, except
aperients, no medicine is necessary, and support
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>may be given by a well-applied flannel
roller; but when the swelling is extensive
and permanent, remaining in the same degree
after the patient has been for several hours
in bed, and connected with uncomfortable
sensations in the head, an accelerated pulse,
&#38;c., a medical man ought to be consulted,
for the consequences might otherwise be dangerous.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Palpitation of the Heart.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>If this affection occur for the first time
during pregnancy, it is rarely connected with
disease of the heart itself; it is therefore
without danger, although very distressing.
Occasionally there is connected with it throbbing
of the vessels in the temples, as also in
the abdomen; the latter not unfrequently
mistaken by the patient for the beatings of
the heart itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will make its attack repeatedly in the
course of a day, particularly after a meal;
and very frequently at night, on first lying
down in bed; and it may be brought on at
any time by the slightest agitation of mind.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Treatment for an attack.</i>—When it comes
on it is to be relieved by putting the hands
and arms up to the elbows in water, as warm
as can be borne—friction with the warm
hand applied to the feet—absolute rest—and
taking the following draught: Compound
spirits of ammonia, half a teaspoonful; Camphor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>mixture, a wine-glass. It may be repeated
again in an hour or so, if necessary.
It will be well to keep a bottle of this mixture
in the bedroom; a resource will always
be then at hand, and the dread which attends
anticipation in a great measure removed.
This is the more necessary, as an attack, if it
comes on in the night, is always very distressing.
The patient awakes, perhaps, out of a
frightful dream, with a sense of fluttering in
the region of the heart—calls out for breath—begs
to have the curtains of the bed withdrawn,
the door of the room opened—and
will tell you she feels as if she was dying;—wine,
brandy, any stimulant that is at hand
is resorted to, for the husband or friend of
the patient is naturally much excited, and in
his alarm scarcely knows how to act. Now
there is no occasion for alarm; the sufferer
must be assured of this; her mind must be
soothed and quieted; the means just pointed
out for the relief of a paroxysm must be used;
the palpitation will after a little time cease,
and the patient will drop off into a quiet and
tranquil sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>These attacks may be prevented</i> by taking
for ten days or a fortnight a teaspoonful of
the following electuary three times a day:—Carbonate
of iron, one ounce and a half;
syrup of ginger, one ounce and a half. The
bowels must be carefully regulated; a tablespoonful
of Elixir Prop. is the best aperient,
provided there are no piles. Fatigue and all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>exertion must be avoided, and the mind kept
perfectly tranquil.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Fainting Fits.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Fainting may occur at any period of
pregnancy; but is most frequent during the first
three months, and especially about the time
of quickening. It may come on when the
person is at perfect rest; but is ordinarily
produced by unusual exertion,—exposure to
heat,—or any sudden excitement of the mind.
The paroxysm or fit is sometimes of short
duration; and the female does not lose her
recollection; she has a knowledge of what
is going on about her, and soon recovers;
but in other instances the fainting fit is complete
and of long duration, continuing for an
hour, or upwards.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The treatment during a fit.</i>—This consists
in immediately placing the patient in a recumbent
posture—the use of pungent volatiles—sprinkling
the face with cold water—free
exposure to air, and the cautious administration
of cordials. And if the fit continue
long, the extremities must be kept warm, and
the friction of a warm hand be applied to the
feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is scarcely necessary to add, that those
who are subject to these attacks ought to
avoid fatigue—crowded or hot rooms—fasting
too long, quick motion, and agitation of
mind. The bowels must be attended to;
and a wine-glass of the infusion of columbo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>or cascarilla, taken every morning, will be
useful in giving tone to the system.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a few weeks the disposition to fainting
will altogether subside, and although a
very alarming state to those who are inexperienced,
yet the subject of it should never
allow her mind to be depressed, or to anticipate
an unfavorable result. Pure air, simple
diet, and regular exercise, as we said above,
will do much to prevent it.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Toothache.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>This may appear a trifling disease, to notice
in connexion with the subject before us:
but, in the course of pregnancy, females will
sometimes suffer severely from erratic pains
in the face and teeth. As these pains are
generally induced by the increased irritability
of the nervous system, the result of the new
action which is going on in the womb, and
not from the decay of any particular tooth,
extraction of any tooth for its cure is out of
the question. Indeed, did the suffering arise
from a carious tooth, its removal is unadvisable,
inasmuch as this operation has been immediately
followed by a miscarriage. The
fact is, that the patients who have consulted
me while suffering from this affection, have
had, apparently, in most cases, very sound
teeth; and, feeling confident that its cause
has been what has been before pointed out,
the treatment has been purely constitutional.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>The following pill may be taken, night and
morning:—Socotrine aloes, one grain and
a half; blue pill, two grains; together with
one drachm of the rust, or carbonate of iron,
mixed with treacle or milk. The latter must
be repeated twice a day for four days, and
then a third dose may be added in the middle
of the day; and the remedy continued, even
after all uneasiness in the face has subsided
for some time, with great advantage to the
general health.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only local application I would advise,
is that of washing out the mouth and teeth,
night and morning, with salt and cold, or
lukewarm water. This plan of treatment
not only relieves the painful affection of the
face and teeth, but allays also that local irritability
of the nerves, upon which it depended.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a carious tooth seems alone affected, it
has been proposed carefully to apply a drop
or two of nitric acid, which is said to be infallible;
a drop or two of oil of kreosote or
cajeput is frequently useful.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Salivation.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>A pregnant female must not be surprised,
if, some little time after conception, or during
any of the months of gestation, the ordinary
quantity of saliva, which lubricates and keeps
the mouth constantly moist, should increase
to such an extent as to be exceedingly troublesome;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>and, indeed, sometimes become so
excessive, as seriously to affect her health.
It is a symptom of pregnancy, but a very
unusual one; although the quantity of saliva
discharged has now and then exceeded three,
and even four pints daily.</p>

<p class='c007'>It differs essentially from the salivation
produced by the exhibition of mercury, inasmuch
as in this case, there is no tenderness
of the gums, or disagreeable fœtor in the
breath. The fluid itself is either perfectly
colorless and transparent, or more tenacious
and frothy. It has an unpleasant taste, and,
when tenacious, induces vomiting. It is
generally accompanied with acidity; and
the plan of <i>treatment</i> most advisable, when
the disease is moderate in its character, is
the frequent use of from twenty to thirty
grains of magnesia, say every morning, rinsing
the mouth out very often with lime-water,
and to resist the desire to discharge
the saliva from the mouth as much as possible,
for, if it is not very great in quantity, it
may be swallowed to advantage. Should
this symptom, however, be very excessive,
the health will suffer considerably in consequence,
and the assistance of the medical
man is imperatively called for.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>A Painful and Distended Condition of the Breasts.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pain and tension of the breasts frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>attend, as also they are natural consequences
of, conception.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a first pregnancy, a large and rapid
development of this organ may take place,
the breast becoming two or three times as
large as before marriage; but if tight lacing
be only avoided, and the breasts be permitted
to expand, no material inconvenience
will arise from this circumstance.</p>

<p class='c007'>As, however, these symptoms are sometimes
attended with considerable distress, I
would advise, under such circumstances, the
application of half a dozen leeches, or more,
tepid fomentations, and a gentle aperient—two
drachms of Epsom salts in a little peppermint
water—night and morning. These
means, by relieving the over distension and
fulness of the vessels of the part, remove
the cause and complaint at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>If these symptoms occur to a female who
may have been several times pregnant, and
formerly has had an abscess in one or other
breast, that bosom is generally most painful
which was before affected, and there will
be an increased hardness about it, which
may give rise, perhaps, to the apprehension
of an abscess again forming, or, what is much
worse, to the disease terminating in cancer.
Both these fears are groundless: and, if she
will only use fomentations, gentle friction
frequently during the day, with almond oil
and laudanum—about a drachm of the latter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>to an ounce of the oil, warm,—and exercise
patience, everything will do very well.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nature often seeks her own cure, and a
colourless, thin fluid runs from the nipple,
which relieves the symptoms.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Cramp, and Pains in the Legs, &#38;c.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Some females, during the latter months of
pregnancy, suffer dreadfully from cramp
and pain in the legs, and about the sides and
lower part of the stomach. This symptom
arises from the pressure of the womb upon
certain nerves in its neighbourhood, which
proceed to the extremities.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the cramp be seated in the muscles of
the legs, a hard, knotty induration is perceivable
to the touch, accompanied with
great soreness, the latter continuing for a
long time after the lump has disappeared.
An uneasy position of the muscles is a sufficient
cause of irritation, to produce it, and it
is frequently removed, by simply rising from
the bed or sofa, and walking the room, so as
to put the muscles of the leg into action.
If this does not succeed, warm friction with
the naked hand, or with camphorated oil,
generally will.</p>

<p class='c007'>If spasm affect the sides, or lower part of
the stomach, the speediest relief will be obtained
from twenty, to five-and-twenty, or
thirty drops of laudanum, with a little ether,
in distilled peppermint water, or, even at the
moment, a little brandy and water; but I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>generally order, for patients who are at all
subject to this affection, the following mixture:—Batley’s
sedative solution of opium,
one drachm; compound tincture of lavender,
half an ounce; distilled peppermint
water, six ounces. Two tablespoonfuls to
be taken before retiring to rest, if there is
the slightest intimation of an approaching
attack, and also direct that the feet be put
into a mustard foot-bath. During the attack,
great benefit will be derived from the external
application of hot flannels, moistened
with the compound camphor liniment.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Violent movements of the Child.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Before the third month of pregnancy, the
child is not sufficiently developed to enable
it to move. When a little further advanced
in growth, it moves, but so feebly and imperfectly,
that the mother is not yet sensible
of it. A period, however, soon arrives,
when its movements, although at first like
the mere fluttering of a bird, acquire a power
and force, that enable it to give decided
proof of life. It is instantly recognised, the
female knows she has quickened, and perhaps
the sensation experienced is so sudden,
that she faints. After this time the motions
of the child increase both in frequency and
degree, and are readily perceived by the
mother, but after a time the womb accustomed
to this action within itself, is less sensible
of its effects, and except as a satisfactory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>evidence of the life of the child, is little
regarded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes, however, the child is <i>disagreeably</i>
active, so violent as not merely to alarm
the mother, but occasion much sickness and
uneasiness;—sleepless nights; feverish symptoms,
&#38;c., and all this to such an extent, as
to require medical interference. If this is
not thought necessary, relief will be obtained
from losing blood, when not otherwise objectionable,
to the amount of a few ounces;
gentle aperients, and a night draught containing
from twenty-five to thirty drops of
Batley’s sedative solution of opium. These
remedies will afford the greatest relief, and
if the symptoms are not altogether removed by
them, the female must then endure patiently,
recollecting they are a proof that the child is
alive and vigorous.<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Soreness and Cracking of the Skin of the Abdomen.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>It will sometimes happen during the latter
months of pregnancy, that the skin covering
the abdomen will not yield readily. This
produces much uneasiness; the skin becomes
tender and fretted, and if there is very great
distension, cracks. It forms a source of
great discomfort, and renders the female miserable
whenever she moves.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>It is to be relieved by fomenting the parts
with a decoction of poppy-heads;<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c012'><sup>[26]</sup></a> and the
frequent use of warm almond oil, applying in
the intervals spermaceti ointment, spread
very thinly on a piece of soft linen.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Inconvenience from Size.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Many women in the latter months of gestation
experience considerable annoyance,
and sometimes severe suffering from the
great size of the abdomen, and from want of
support, when even not so very large. This
is a rare occurrence in a first pregnancy,
owing to the firmness of the abdominal muscles,
but very frequent in subsequent ones.
Little women especially suffer from this unpleasant
cause, and, in fact, it is so universally
the case with all, who have borne children
<i>rapidly</i>, that it is highly important for a female
to be provided with the means of relieving
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is but one remedy with which I am
acquainted, but have usually found it answer
every purpose. It is wearing during the
day-time <i>a well-applied belt</i>, next the skin.
It must be sufficiently broad for its upper
edge to surround the abdomen above the
point of its greatest diameter, and its lower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>edge to come down to, and be supported by,
the hips. It must be drawn tight by a lace-string
behind, as circumstances may require,
and it must likewise be supported by broad
straps passing over the shoulders. This will
give the required support to the womb, and
when the patient is in an upright position, as
much as possible of the weight, of what she
externally carries, will be thrown upon, or
hang from, her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who suffer much from this cause,
ought also to lie down upon a couch or bed,
for two or three hours every day; this will
give great relief to the muscles.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Being Unwell during Pregnancy.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>A female may be pregnant, and yet be unwell
for one period or more while in that
condition. Indeed, it may take place every
month to the time of quickening, and has
even continued in some rare cases up to the
time of delivery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, although this can scarcely be called
one of the diseases of pregnancy—for it, ordinarily,
in no way, interferes with the
health—still, as while the discharge is actually
present it predisposes to miscarriage, it
is necessary to give one or two hints of
caution.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any female, then, thus circumstanced
should manage herself with great care immediately
before the appearance, during the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>existence—and directly after the cessation of
the discharge. She should observe the most
perfect quiet of body and mind—keeping
upon the sofa while it lasts, and carefully abstaining
from any stimulating or indigestible
article of food, and if any symptoms of pain,
uneasiness, or threatening miscarriage come
on, immediately seek medical advice.</p>

<p class='c007'>A case, showing the necessity of carefulness
under such circumstances, occurred to
me some time since, and its relation is all
that I need add upon this point.</p>

<p class='c007'>A lady, resident in Gloucestershire, missing
one period, suspected herself of being pregnant,
but being unwell on the following month,
supposed herself mistaken. She had occasion,
however, to come to London on the second
day of her being unwell—Monday.
On the Wednesday following she suffered
considerable uneasiness from the exertion attendant
upon the journey, and on Friday
while from her hotel was obliged to return
home in haste, and before night, miscarried.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here then is a case in point—first proving,
what some persons deny, that a female may be
unwell and yet be pregnant, for she could
not perceive the slightest difference in the appearance
of the discharge from what ordinarily
took place, and it was exact as to the
time of its return—and next, showing how
necessary is great caution, and the most perfect
quiet, since undoubtedly this lady would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>not have miscarried, if her journey had only
been delayed another week.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jaundice sometimes occurs in the early or
latter parts of the pregnancy—certain affections
also of disordered functions of the heart,
producing palpitation—a troublesome cough,
accompanied with considerable pain in the
head, sudden attacks of difficulty of breathing,
and distressing inconvenience from irritable
bladder.</p>

<p class='c007'>These, and many other slight affections,
may manifest themselves during gestation,
but of those I say nothing. It would be advancing
beyond the bounds by which I
thought it right to limit myself, and departing
from the object proposed.<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c012'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>I have finished what was purposed, and
presented the married female with that information
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>for direction and relief, in those
little ailments and discomforts which frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>arise during pregnancy, for which
she does not think it necessary to consult her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>medical adviser, and yet from which she will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>not unfrequently go on suffering for weeks,
rather than speak of them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>PREVENTION TO CONCEPTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We have seen from the preceding pages,
that in addition to what may be termed diseases
ordinarily attendant upon a state of
pregnancy, there are others in which to become
pregnant is to hazard the health, and
often the life of the woman, involving a peremptory
necessity either for instrumental or
Cæsarean operation, premature delivery or
miscarriage. Apart from its agonizing torture,
the danger of the Cæsarean operation
is imminent to a frightful extent. Premature
delivery is often attended with success, but
the offspring being prematurely born, if they
survive, rarely attain maturity, and even then
mostly during their short existence very
sickly. Miscarriage, although attended with
but little danger when skilfully effected and
properly conducted, can only be considered
as an alternative; only a choice of evils.
But thanks to the indefatigable researches of
the learned and humane M.M. Desomeaux
for his great discovery by which <i>pregnancy
can be prevented</i>. By this discovery every
woman can have in her own power the
means of prevention.</p>

<p class='c007'>The imperative, and self-evident necessity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>that, in some cases, pregnancy should not
take place, cannot, for a moment, be doubted,
in view that it is within the knowledge of
every medical man, who makes his profession
subserve the amelioration of the suffering to
which the female is subject—knowledge, too,
acquired within the sphere of his daily practice—that
there are women who should not
become pregnant, for with them pregnancy
is peril to life. And even when life is spared,
the birth of every child snatches many years
from the life of the mother, hurrying her,
with a constitution shattered, and health destroyed,
to a premature grave.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some women are so constituted that they
cannot give birth, not to say to <i>healthy</i>, but
not to <i>living</i> children. Others again cannot
give birth at all, except through the instrumental
mangling and cutting of the Cæsarean
operation—of a piece-meal extraction of the
infant from the mother’s womb—happy, indeed,
if the woman’s life fall not a sacrifice
to the butchery. Truly, such spectacles are
too horrid to contemplate. And yet such
women are permitted to become pregnant, in
total ignorance that pregnancy ought and
can be <i>prevented</i>, by safe, simple, invariably
healthy, and infallibly certain means.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some women, again, although not in immediate
danger from becoming too frequently
pregnant, yet during seven or eight of the
nine months of pregnancy, experience the
utmost agony of mind and body, making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>existence a continuous state of misery and
suffering, destructive alike of their health,
beauty, vigor, and spirits; who, after confinement
and recovery, live in constant and
perpetual fear and dread of again becoming
pregnant, again to undergo the series of intense
sufferings from which they have but
just emerged. Life, under such circumstances,
to the fond and affectionate wife, is
but a constant suffering. Can it be otherwise
to the kind husband? Can he behold
the partner of his joys and sorrows—his
bosom companion—the mother of his children—his
solace in sickness or difficulty, thus
dragging out her days of wretchedness and
anguish, emaciated, disheartened, broken in
body and spirits; and that, too, in the meridian
of her life, in the hey-day of her existence,
perceptibly sinking into an early grave,
to leave her offspring motherless, or entrust
them to the cold and sordid care of the world!
Can a husband, possessing the feelings of a
man, behold this with indifference; nay, will
he not shudder at the possibility of such consequences
arising from too frequent pregnancy!
Will he not pause and reflect ere
he becomes the cause from which such dreadful
effects would flow? Surely, if he is a
thinking, reflecting, rational, humane man, he
must reflect—he must pause, and permit the
adoption of the mode pointed out in these
pages, by which pregnancy can be prevented,
and that, too, without the least sacrifice of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>those pleasurable sensations experienced in
the connubial embrace.</p>

<p class='c007'>The happiness as well of husband, of wife,
and children, will be enhanced by the preservation
of her health, by lengthening the intervals
between the periods of pregnancy, making the
interval between the births three, four, or
more years (as in France), depending upon
the health of the wife. Thereby it will,
under ordinary circumstances, be preserved
to rear, guard, and educate her children,—to
soothe and comfort the declining years of the
father when age and decrepitude are upon
him. When, perchance, his own sufferings
can be assuaged by only her hand, who alone
knows and anticipates his every wish—whose
affectionate attention, having accompanied
him through the rugged path of life, alone
knows how to impart content and happiness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Surely, then, circumstances do arise where
it is folly, madness, wickedness, to permit
pregnancy to take place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where, for example, the health of the wife
evidently sinks under a too frequent state of
pregnancy or a too rapid increase of family;
or the births taking place in too close succession.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where the female cannot be in a state of
pregnancy without the most intense and excruciating
suffering during such period, endangering
her own future health, and perhaps
that of her offspring.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where an incapacity exists to give birth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>to <i>living</i> children, either in consequence of
malformation of the pelvis, or other deformity;
and where, from the same, or other
causes, recourse is necessarily had to the
Cæsarean operation. All which causes have
either the health or the life of the female in
view.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there are still other reasons scarcely
less urgent why pregnancy should be sometimes
prevented, which have the welfare of
the offspring in view.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is but too lamentable a fact that the sins
or misfortunes of the parent are visited upon
their offspring. It is indisputable that diseases
which carry off their thousands, are,
many of them, hereditary,—transmissible
from parent to child. Such as confirmed
consumption, King’s Evil, or Scrofula, Gout,
Venereal Disease, Hypochondria, Insanity,
and other diseases, and even drunkenness.</p>

<p class='c007'>In view, then, of the transmission of disease
and suffering to our offspring, should
they even survive a brief existence, every
reflecting being should hesitate whether it
were not better to prevent pregnancy than
to thrust human beings into the world, and
blighting their brief existence with entailed
disease and wretchedness—for such offspring
are seldom reared to maturity. This fact
accounts for the great mortality of children,
especially in cities. Those, however, that
do pass through a sickly childhood, becoming
necessarily endeared to their parents, are cut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>off in their early years—sometimes in the
bloom of youth—blasting the fond hopes just
springing into existence in the breasts of
their parents. Thus, in some families, five or
six, one after another, are apparently prematurely
cut off.</p>

<p class='c007'>The causes, doubtless, to a superficial observer,
looking only upon effects, appear inexplicable:
not so to those who look beyond
mere effects. To such the <i>present</i> is but
the child of the <i>past</i>, and the <i>parent</i> of the
<i>future</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In discussing, therefore, the propriety, the
morality, nay, the inevitable necessity, in
some cases, of preventing pregnancy, it has
an important bearing.</p>

<p class='c007'>In presenting these considerations, however,
we must bear in mind that they are not
applicable where the female is capable of
enduring the ordinary inconveniences arising
from a state of pregnancy, or where her
health is not thereby injuriously affected, because
the reasons for prevention do not, in
such case, exist. Indeed, it is not unusual,
that the health of the female, so far from
being injured, is often improved, in consequence
of the existence of pregnancy, and
others, again, who enjoy perfect health
without reference to their condition in this
respect.</p>

<p class='c007'>And, again, it is unquestionable that children
are often a source of domestic happiness—the
binding link—the pledge of affection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>and love—the delight and joy of parents,
upon whose growth and development
they look with pride mingled with fond anticipations
of the future. The paths of life
are made less rugged, the charms of home
more pleasant, toil itself becomes less irksome
by their influence.</p>

<p class='c007'>When, therefore, neither the life nor health
of the mother is jeopardized, and the offspring
free from hereditary or constitutional
taint, it is, of course, unnecessary that preventive
measures should be used. Neither
is it, under such circumstances, recommended.</p>

<p class='c007'>In regard, however, to the prevention of
pregnancy, there are still other views, taking
still other grounds, treating the subject in a
moral and social point of view, which, although
not strictly belonging to its consideration
in a medical and physiological character,
are yet of sufficient interest to be embraced
in this work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following remarks are from a celebrated
physiological writer, and are certainly
worthy of consideration, whether we coincide
with the author or not. He thus eloquently
introduces the subject:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Libertines and debauchees! these pages
are not for you. You have nothing to do
with the subject of which they treat. Bringing
to its discussion, as you do, a distrust or
contempt of the human race—accustomed
as you are to confound liberty with license,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>and pleasure with debauchery, it is not for
your palled feelings and brutalized senses to
distinguish moral truth in its purity and simplicity.
I never discuss this subject with
such as you.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It has been remarked, that nothing is so
suspicious in a woman, as vehement pretensions
to especial chastity; it is no less
true, that the most obtrusive and sensitive
stickler for the etiquette of orthodox morality
is the heartless rake. The little intercourse
I have had with men of your stamp,
warns me to avoid the serious discussion of
any species of moral heresy with you. You
approach the subject in a tone and spirit revolting
alike to good taste and good feeling.
You seem to pre-suppose—from your own
experience, perhaps—that the hearts of all
men and more especially of all women, are
deceitful above all things and desperately
wicked; that violence and vice are inherent
in human nature, and that nothing but laws
and ceremonies prevent the world from becoming
a vast slaughter-house, or an universal
brothel. You judge your own sex
and the other by the specimens you have
met with in wretched haunts of mercenary
profligacy; and, with such a standard in
your minds, I marvel not that you remain
incorrigible unbelievers in any virtue, but
that which is forced on the prudish hot-bed
of ceremonious orthodoxy. I wonder not
that you will not trust the natural soil,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>watered from the free skies and warmed by
the life-bringing sun. How should you?
you have never seen it produce but weeds
and poisons. Libertines and debauchees!
cast these pages aside! You will find in
them nothing to gratify a licentious curiosity;
and, if you read them, you will probably
only give me credit for motives and
impulses like your own.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you, prudes and hypocrites! you
who strain at a gnat and swallow a camel;
you whom Jesus likened to whited sepulchres,
which without indeed are beautiful,
but within are full of all uncleanness; you
who affect to blush if the ankle is incidentally
mentioned in conversation, or displayed in
crossing a stile, but will read indecencies
enough, without scruple, in your closets;
you who, at dinner, ask to be helped to the
bosom of a duck, lest by mention of the word
breast, you call up improper associations;
you who have nothing but a head and feet

your ideas of right and wrong are too

<p class='c007'>“Reader! if you belong to the class of

my argument no further. Stop here, and

to prove all things, and hold fast that

which it is every man’s and every woman’s

  <h2 class='c005'>PREVENTION TO CONCEPTION;<br> <span class='small'>CONSIDERED</span><br> <span class='large'>IN ITS SOCIAL BEARINGS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“What would be the probable effect, in
social life, if mankind obtained and exercised
a control over the instinct of reproduction?</p>

<p class='c007'>“My settled conviction is—and I am prepared
to defend it—that the effect would be
salutary, moral, civilizing; that it would prevent
many crimes and more unhappiness;
that it would lessen intemperance and profligacy;
that it would polish the manners and
improve the moral feelings; that it would relieve
the burden of the poor, and the cares
of the rich; that it would most essentially
benefit the rising generation, by enabling parents
generally more carefully to educate,
and more comfortably to provide for, their
offspring. I proceed to substantiate as I
may these positions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And first, let us look solely to the situation
of married persons. Is it not notorious,
that the families of the married often increase
beyond what a regard for the young beings
coming into the world, or the happiness of
those who give them birth, would dictate?
In how many instances does the hard-working
father, and more especially the mother,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>of a poor family, remain slaves throughout
their lives, tugging at the oar of incessant labor,
toiling to live, and living but to toil;
when if their offspring had been limited to
two or three only, they might have enjoyed
comfort and comparative affluence! How
often is the health of the mother, giving birth
every year to an infant—happy if it be not
twins!—and compelled to toil on, even at
those times when nature imperiously calls for
some relief from daily drudgery—how often
is the mother’s comfort, health, nay, her life,
thus sacrificed! Or, if care and toil have
weighed down the spirit, and at last broken
the health of the father, how often is the widow
left, unable, with the most virtuous intentions,
to save her fatherless offspring from
becoming degraded objects of charity, or
profligate votaries of vice!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fathers and mothers! not you who have
your nursery and your nursery-maids, and
who leave your children at home, to frequent
the crowded rout, or to glitter in the hot ball-room;
but you by the labor of whose hands
your children are to live, and who, as you
count their rising numbers, sigh to think how
soon sickness or misfortune may lessen those
wages which are now but just sufficient to afford
them bread—fathers and mothers in
humble life! to you my argument comes
home, with the force of reality. Others may
impugn—may ridicule it. By bitter experience
you know and feel its truth.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>“Yet this is not all. Every physician
knows, that there are many women so constituted
that they cannot give birth to healthy—sometimes
not to <i>living</i> children. Is it desirable—is
it <i>moral</i>, that such women should
become pregnant? Yet this is continually
the case, the warnings of physicians to the
contrary notwithstanding. Others there are,
who ought never to become parents; because,
if they do, it is only to transmit to their
offspring grievous hereditary diseases; perhaps
that worst of diseases, insanity. Yet
they will not lead a life of celibacy. They
marry. They become parents, and the world
suffers by it. That a human being should
give birth to a child, knowing that he transmits
to it hereditary disease, is in my opinion
an immorality. But it is a folly to expect
that we can ever induce all such persons to
live the lives of Shakers. Nor is it necessary;
all that duty requires of them is, to
refrain from becoming parents. Who can
estimate the beneficial effect which rational
moral restraint may thus have, on the health,
beauty, and physical improvement of our
race, throughout future generations?</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, apart from these latter considerations,
is it not most plainly, clearly, incontrovertibly
<i>desirable</i>, that parents <i>should have
the power</i><a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a> to limit their offspring, whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>they choose to exercise it or not? Who <i>can</i>
lose by their having this power? and how
many <i>may</i> gain! may gain competency for
themselves, and the opportunity carefully to
educate and provide for their children! How
many may escape the jarrings, the quarrels,
the disorder, the anxiety, which an overgrown
family too often causes in the domestic
circle?</p>

<p class='c007'>“It sometimes happens, that individual instances
come home to the feelings with greater
force than any general reasoning. I shall,
in this place, adduce one which came immediately
under my cognizance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In June, 1829, I received from an elderly
gentleman of the first respectability, occupying
a public situation in one of the western
states, a letter requesting to know whether
I could afford any information or advice in a
case which greatly interested him and which
regarded a young woman for whom he had
ever experienced the sentiments of a father.
In explanation of the circumstances to which
he alluded, he enclosed me a copy of a letter
which she had just written to him, and which
I here transcribe verbatim. A letter more
touching from its simplicity, or more strikingly
illustrative of the unfortunate situation in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>which not one, but thousands, in married life,
find themselves placed, I have never read.</p>

you and my father, ever since I can remember;
the unaffected kindness you used to express
towards me, when you resided in our
neighborhood, during my childhood; the lively
solicitude you have always seemed to feel
for my welfare, and your benevolence and
liberal character, induce me to lay before you
in a few words, my critical situation, and ask
you for your kind advice.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘It is my lot to be united in wedlock
to a young mechanic of industrious habits,
good dispositions, pleasing manners, and
agreeable features, excessively fond of our
children and of me; in short, eminently well
qualified to render himself and family and all
around him happy, were it not for the besetting
sin of drunkenness. About once in
every three or four weeks, if he meet, either
accidentally or purposely, with some of his
friends, of whom, either real or pretended,
his good nature and liberality procure him
many, he is sure to get intoxicated, so as to
lose his reason; and, when thus beside himself,
he trades and makes foolish bargains, so
much to his disadvantage, that he has almost
reduced himself and family to beggary, being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>no longer able to keep a shop of his own,
but obliged to work journey work.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘We have not been married quite four
years, and have already given being to three
dear little ones. Under present circumstances,
what can I expect will be their fate and
mine? I shudder at the prospect before me.
With my excellent constitution and industry,
and the labor of my husband, I feel able to
bring up these three little cherubs in decency,
were I to have no more: but when I seriously
consider my situation, I can see no
other alternative left for me, than to tear myself
away from the man who, though addicted
to occasional intoxication, would sacrifice
his life for my sake; and for whom, contrary
to my father’s will, I successively refused
the hand and wealth of a lawyer and of a
preacher; or continue to witness his degradation,
and bring into existence, in all probability,
a numerous family of helpless and
destitute children, who, on account of poverty,
must inevitably be doomed to a life of
ignorance, and consequent vice and misery.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Need I add one word of comment on
such a case as this? Every feeling mind
must be touched by the amiable feeling and
good sense that pervade the letter. Every
rational being, surely, must admit, that the
power of preventing, without injury or sacrifice,
the increase of a family, under such circumstances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>is a public benefit and a private
blessing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will it be asserted—and I know no other
even plausible reply to these facts and arguments—will
it be asserted, that the thing is,
in itself, immoral or unseemly? I deny it;
and I point to the population of France, in
justification of my denial. Where will you
find, on the face of the globe, a more polished
or more civilized nation than the French, or
one more punctiliously alive to any rudeness,
coarseness or indecorum? You will find
none. The French are scrupulous on these
points, to a proverb. Yet, as every intelligent
traveller in France must have remarked,
there is scarcely to be found, among
the middle or upper classes (and seldom
even among the working classes), such a
thing as a large family; very seldom more
than three or four children. A French lady
of the utmost delicacy and respectability
will, in common conversation, say as simply—(ay,
and as <i>innocently</i>, whatever the self-righteous
prude may aver to the contrary)—as
she would proffer any common remark
about the weather: ‘I have three children;
my husband and I think that is as many as
we can do justice to, and I do not intend to
have any more.’<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“I have stated notorious facts, facts
which no traveller who has visited Paris,
and seen anything of the domestic life of its
inhabitants, will attempt to deny. However
heterodox, then, my view of the subject may
be in this country, I am supported in it by
the opinion and the practice of the most refined
and most socially cultivated nation in
the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will it still be argued, that the practice,
if not coarse, is immoral? Again, I appeal
to France. I appeal to the details of the
late glorious revolution—to the innumerable
instances of moderation, of courage, of
honesty, of disinterestedness, of generosity,
of magnanimity, displayed on the memorable
‘three days,’ and ever since; and I challenge
comparison between the national character
of France for virtue, as well as politeness,
and that of any other nation under heaven.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is evident, then, that to married persons,
the power of limiting their offspring to
their circumstances is most desirable. It
may often promote the harmony, peace, and
comfort of families; sometimes it may save
from bankruptcy and ruin, and sometimes it
may rescue the mother from premature
death. In <i>no</i> case can it, by possibility, be
worse than superfluous. In <i>no case can it be
mischievous</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the moral feelings were carefully cultivated,
if we were taught to consult, in
everything, rather the welfare of those we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>love than our own, how strongly would
these arguments be felt? No man ought
even to <i>desire</i> that a woman should become
the mother of his children, unless it was her
express wish, and unless he knew it to be for
her welfare, that she should. Her feelings,
her interests, should be for him in this matter
<i>an imperative law</i>. She it is who bears the
burden, and therefore with her also should
the decision rest. Surely it may well be a
question whether it be desirable, or whether
any man ought to ask, that the whole life of
an intellectual, cultivated woman, should be
spent in bearing a family of twelve or fifteen
children; to the ruin, perhaps, of her constitution,
if not to the overstocking of the
world. No man ought to require or expect
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shall I be told, that this is the very romance
of morality? Alas! that what
ought to be a matter of every day practice—a
commonplace exercise of the duties and
charities of life—a bounden duty—an instance
of domestic courtesy too universal
either to excite remark or to merit commendation—alas!
that a virtue so humble that its
absence ought to be reproached as a crime,
should, to our selfish perceptions, seem but a
fastidious refinement, or a fanciful supererogation!</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I pass from the case of married persons
to that of young men and women who
have yet formed no matrimonial connexion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“In the present state of the world, when
public opinion stamps with opprobrium every
sexual connection which has not received the
orthodox sanction of an oath, almost all
young persons, on reaching the age of maturity,
desire to marry. The heart must be
very cold, or very isolated, that does not find
some object on which to bestow its affections.
Thus, early marriages would be
almost universal, did not prudential considerations
interfere. The young man thinks,
‘I must not marry yet. I cannot support a
family. I must make money first, and think
of a matrimonial settlement afterwards.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“And so he goes to making money, fully
and sincerely resolved, in a few years to
share it with her whom he now loves. But
passions are strong, and temptations great.
Curiosity, perhaps, introduces him into the
company of those poor creatures whom society
first reduces to a dependence on the
most miserable of mercenary trades, and
then curses for being what she has made
them. There his health and his moral feelings
alike are made shipwreck. The affections
he had thought to treasure up for their
first object, are chilled by dissipation and
blunted by excess. He scarcely retains a
passion but avarice. Years pass on—years
of profligacy and speculation—and his first
wish is accomplished; his fortune is made.
Where now are the feelings and resolves of
his youth?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“‘Like the dew on the mountain,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Like the foam on the river,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like the bubble on the fountain,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They are gone—and for ever?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“He is a man of pleasure—a man of the
world. He laughs at the romance of his
youth, and marries a fortune. If gaudy equipages
and gay parties confer happiness, he
is happy. But if these be only the sunshine
on the stormy ocean below, he is a victim to
that system of morality which forbids a
reputable connexion until the period when
provision has been made for a large, expected
family. Had he married the first object of
his choice, and simply delayed becoming a
father until his prospects seemed to warrant
it, how different might have been his lot!
Until men and women are absolved from the
fear of becoming parents, except when they
themselves desire it, they ever will form
mercenary and demoralizing connexions, and
seek in dissipation the happiness they might
have found in domestic life.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know that this, however common, is
not an universal case. Sometimes the heavy
responsibilities of a family are incurred at all
risks; and who shall say how often a life of
unremitting toil and poverty is the consequence?
Sometimes—if even rarely—the
young mind <i>does</i> hold to its first resolves.
The youth plods through years of cold celibacy
and solitary anxiety; happy, if before
the best hours of life are gone, and its warmest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>feelings withered, he may return to claim
the reward of his forbearance and of his industry.
But even in this comparatively
happy case, shall we count for nothing the
years of ascetical sacrifice at which after-happiness
is purchased? The days of youth
are not too many, nor its affections too lasting.
We may, indeed, if a great object
require it, sacrifice the one and mortify the
other. But is this, in itself, desirable? Does
not wisdom tell that such sacrifice is a dead
loss—to the warm-hearted often a grievous
one? Does not wisdom bid us temperately
enjoy the spring-time of life, ‘while the evil
days come not, nor the years draw nigh’
when we shall say, ‘we have no pleasure in
them?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us say, then, if we will, that the youth
who thus sacrifices the present for the future,
chooses wisely between two evils, profligacy
and asceticism. This is true. But let us not
imagine the lesser evil to be a good. It is <i>not</i>
good for man to be alone. It is for no man’s
or woman’s happiness or benefit that they
should be condemned to Shakerism. It is a
violence done to the feelings, and an injury
to the character. A life of rigid celibacy,
though infinitely preferable to a life of dissipation,
is yet fraught with many evils. Peevishness,
restlessness, vague longings, and
instability of character, are among the least
of these. The mind is unsettled, and the
judgment warped. Even the very instinct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>which is thus mortified assumes an undue
importance, and occupies a portion of the
thoughts which does not of right or nature
belong to it; and which, during a life of
satisfied affection, it would not obtain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I speak not now of extreme cases, where
solitary vice<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a> or disease, or even insanity,
has been the result of ascetical mortification.
I speak of every day cases; and I am well
convinced that (however wise it often is, in
the present state of the world, to select and
adhere to this alternative), yet no man or
woman can live the life of a conscientious
Shaker, without suffering, more or less, both
physically, mentally, and morally. This is
the more to be regretted, because the very
noblest portion of our species—the good, the
pure, the high-minded, and the kind-hearted—are
the chief victims.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thus, inasmuch as the scruple of incurring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>heavy responsibilities deters from forming
moral connexions, and encourages intemperance
and prostitution, the knowledge
which enables man to limit his offspring,
would, in the present state of things, save
much unhappiness and prevent many crimes.
Young persons sincerely attached to each
other, and who might wish to marry, would
marry early; merely resolving not to become
parents until prudence permitted it.
The young man, instead of solitary toil or
vulgar dissipation, would enjoy the society
and the assistance of her he had chosen as
his companion; and the best years of life,
whose pleasures never return, would not be
squandered in riot, or lost through mortification.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My readers will remark, that all the arguments
I have hitherto employed, apply
strictly to the present order of things, and
the present laws and system of marriage.
No one, therefore, need be a moral heretic
on this subject to admit and approve them.
The marriage laws might all remain for ever
as they are; and yet a moral check to population
would be beneficent and important.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But there are other cases, it will be said,
where the knowledge of a preventive would
be mischievous. If young women, it will
be argued, were absolved from the fear of
consequences, they would rarely preserve
their chastity. Unlegalized connexions would
be common and seldom detected. Seduction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>would be facilitated. Let us dispassionately
examine this argument.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I fully agree with that most amiable of
moral heretics, Shelley, that ‘Seduction,
which term could have no meaning in a rational
society, has now a most tremendous
one.’<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c012'><sup>[32]</sup></a> It matters not how artificial the penalty
which society has chosen to affix to a
breach of her capricious decrees. Society
has the power in her own hands; and that
moral Shylock, Public Opinion, enforces the
penalty, even though it cost the life of the
victim. The consequences, then, to the poor
sufferer, whose offence is, at most, but an
error of judgment or a weakness of the heart,
are the same as if her imprudence were indeed
a crime of the blackest dye. And his
conduct who, for a momentary, selfish gratification,
will deliberately entail a life of
wretchedness on one whose chief fault, perhaps,
was her misplaced confidence in a villain,
is not one whit excused by the folly and
injustice of the sentence.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c012'><sup>[33]</sup></a> Some poet says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>‘The man who lays his hands upon a woman,</div>

      <div class='line'>Whom ’twere gross flattery to call a coward.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>What epithet then belongs to him who makes
it a trade to win a woman’s gentle affections,
betray her generous confidence, and then,
when the consequences become apparent,
abandon her to dependence, and the scorn of
a cold, a self-righteous, and a wicked world;
a world which will forgive anything but rebellion
against its tyranny, and in whose eyes
it seems the greatest of crimes to be unsuspecting
and warm-hearted! I will give my
hand freely to a galley-slave, and speak to
the highway-robber as to an honest man;
but there is one character with whom I desire
to exchange neither word nor greeting—the
cold-hearted, deliberate, practised, and calculating
seducer!</p>

<p class='c007'>“And, let me ask, what is it gives to the
arts of seduction their sting, and stamps to
the world its victim? Why is it, that the
man goes free and enters society again, almost
courted and applauded for his treachery,
while the woman is a mark for the finger
of reproach, and a butt for the tongue of
scandal? Because she bears about her the
mark of what is called her disgrace. She
becomes a mother; and society has something
tangible against which to direct its
anathemas. Nine-tenths, at least, of the
misery and ruin which are caused by seduction,
even in the present state of public opinion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>on the subject, result from cases of pregnancy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the little being lives, the dove in the
falcon’s claws is not more certain of death,
than we may be, that society will visit, with
its bitterest scoffs and reproaches, the bruised
spirit of the mother and the unconscious innocence
of the child.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If, then, we cannot do all, shall we neglect
a part? If we cannot prevent every
misery which man’s selfishness and the
world’s cruelty entail on a sex which it ought
to be our pride and honor to cherish and defend;
let us prevent as many as we can. If
we cannot persuade society to revoke its unmanly
and <i>unchristian</i><a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a> persecution of those
who are often the best and gentlest of its
members—let us, at the least, give to woman
what defence we may, against its violence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I appeal to any father, trembling for the
reputation of his child, whether, if she were
induced to form an unlegalized connexion,
her pregnancy would not be a frightful
aggravation? I appeal to him, whether a
preventive which shall save her from a
situation which must soon disclose all to the
world, would not be an act of mercy, of
charity, of philanthropy—whether it might
not save him from despair, and her from ruin?
The fastidious conformist may frown
upon the question, but to the father it comes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>home; and, whatever his lips may say, his
heart will acknowledge the soundness and
the force of the argument it conveys.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It may be, that sticklers for morality will
still demur to the positions I defend. They
will perhaps tell me, as the committee of a
certain society in this city lately did—that
the power of preventing conception ‘holds
out inducements and facilities for the prostitution
of their daughters, their sisters, and
their wives.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Truly, but they pay their wives, their
sisters, and their daughters, a poor compliment!
Is, then, this vaunted chastity a mere
thing of circumstance and occasion? Is
there but the difference of opportunity between
it and prostitution? Would their
wives, and their sisters, and their daughters,
if once absolved from the fear of offspring,
all become prostitutes—and sell their embrace
for gold, and descend to a level with
the most degraded? In truth, but they slander
their own kindred: they libel their own
wives, sisters, and daughters. If they spoke
truth—if fear were indeed the only safeguard
of their relatives’ chastity, little value should
I place on virtue like that! and small would
I esteem his offence, who should attempt to
seduce it.<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c012'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“That chastity which is worth preserving
is not the chastity that owes its birth to fear
and to ignorance. If to enlighten a woman
regarding a simple physiological fact will
make her a prostitute, she must be especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>predisposed to profligacy. But it is a libel
on the sex. Few, indeed, there are, who
would continue so miserable and degrading
a calling, could they but escape from it. For
one prostitute that is made by inclination,
ten are made by necessity. Reform the
laws—equalize the comforts of society, and
you need withhold no knowledge from your
wives and daughters. It is want, not knowledge,
that leads to prostitution.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For myself, I would withhold from no sister,
or daughter, or wife of mine, any ascertained
fact whatever. It should be to me a
duty and a pleasure to communicate to them
all I knew myself; and I should hold it an
insult to their understandings and their hearts
to imagine, that their virtue would diminish
as their knowledge increased. Vice is never
the offspring of just knowledge, and they
who say it is, slander their own nature.
Would we but trust human nature, instead
of continually suspecting it, and guarding it
by bolts and bars, and thinking to make it
very chaste by keeping it very ignorant,
what a different world we should have of it!
The virtue of ignorance is a sickly plant,
ever exposed to the caterpillar of corruption,
liable to be scorched and blasted even by
the free light of heaven; of precarious
growth; and even if at last artificially matured,
of little or no real value.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know that parents often think it right
and proper to withhold from their children—especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>from their daughters—facts the
most influential on their future lives, and the
knowledge of which is essential to every
man and woman’s well-being.<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c012'><sup>[36]</sup></a> Such a
course has ever appeared to me ill-judged
and productive of very injurious effects. A
girl is surely no whit the better for believing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>until her marriage night, that children are
found among the cabbage leaves in the garden.
The imagination is excited, the curiosity
kept continually on the stretch; and that
which, if simply explained, would have been
recollected only as any other physiological
phenomenon, assumes all the rank and importance
and engrossing interest of a mystery.
Nay, I am well convinced, that mere
curiosity has often led ignorant young people
into situations, from which a little more confidence
and openness on the part of their
parents and guardians, would have effectually
secured them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But if we <i>could</i> prevent the circulation of
truth, why <i>should</i> we? We are not afraid
of it ourselves. No man thinks <i>his</i> morality
will suffer by it. Each feels certain that his
virtue can stand any degree of knowledge.
And is it not the height of egregious presumption
in each to imagine that his neighbor
is so much weaker than himself, and
requires a bandage which he can do without?
Most of all is it presumptuous to suppose, that
that knowledge which the man of the world
can bear with impunity, will corrupt the
young and the pure-hearted. It is the sullied
conscience only that suggests such fears.
Trust youth and innocence. Speak to them
openly. Show them that you respect them,
by treating them with confidence; and they
will quickly learn to respect and to govern
themselves. You enlist even their pride in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>your behalf; and you will soon see them
make it their boast and their highest pleasure
to <i>merit</i> your confidence. But watch them,
and show your suspicions of them but once,—and
you are the jailor, who will keep his
prisoners just as long as bars and bolts shall
prevent their escape. The world was never
made for a prison-house; it is too large and
ill-guarded: nor were parents ever intended
for jail-keepers; their very affections unfit
them for the task.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is no more beautiful sight on earth,
than a family among whom there are no secrets
and no reserves; where the young
people confide everything to their elder
friends—for such to them are their parents—and
where the parents trust everything to
their children; where each thought is communicated
as freely as it arises; and all
knowledge given, as simply as it is received.
If the world contain a prototype of that
Paradise, where nature is said to have known
no sin or impropriety, it is such a family;
and if there be a serpent that can poison the
innocence of its inmates, that serpent is <span class='fss'>SUSPICION</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I ask no greater pleasure than thus to be
the guardian and companion of young beings
whose innocence shall speak to me as unreservedly
as it thinks to itself; of young beings
who shall never imagine that there is guilt
in their thoughts, or sin in their confidence;
and to whom, in return, I may impart every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>important and useful fact that is known to
myself. Their virtue shall be of that hardy
growth, which <i>all</i> facts tend to nourish and
strengthen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I put it to my readers, whether such a
view of human nature, and such a mode of
treating it, be not in accordance with the
noblest feelings of their hearts. I put it to
them, whether they have not felt themselves
encouraged, improved, strengthened in every
virtuous resolution, when they were generously
trusted; and whether they have not
felt abased and degraded, when they were
suspiciously watched, and spied after, and
kept in ignorance. If they find such feelings
in their own hearts, let them not self-righteously
imagine, that they can only be won
by generosity, or that the nature of their fellow-creatures
is different from their own.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are other considerations connected
with this subject, which farther attest the social
advantages of the control I advocate.
Human affections are mutable, and the sincerest
of moral resolutions may change.<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c012'><sup>[37]</sup></a>
Every day furnishes instances of alienations,
and of separations; sometimes almost before
the honey-moon is well expired. In such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>cases of unsuitability, it cannot be considered
desirable that there should be offspring; and
the power of refraining from becoming parents
until intimacy had, in a measure, established
the likelihood of permanent harmony
of views and feelings, must be confessed to
be advantageous.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would be impossible to meet every argument
in detail, which ingenuity or prejudice
might put forward. If the world were
not actually afraid to think freely or to listen
to the suggestions of common sense, three-fourths
of what has already been said would
be superfluous; for most of the arguments
employed would occur spontaneously to any
rational, reasoning being. But the mass of
mankind have still, in a measure, everything
to learn on this subject. The world seems
to me much to resemble a company of gourmands,
who sit down to a plentiful repast,
first very punctiliously saying grace over it;
and then, under the sanction of the priest’s
blessing, think to gorge themselves with impunity;
as conceiving, that gluttony after
grace is no sin. So it is with popular customs
and popular morality. Everything is
permitted, if external forms be but respected.
Legal roguery is no crime, and ceremony-sanctioned
excess no profligacy. The substance
is sacrificed to the form, the virtue to
the outward observance. The world troubles
its head little about whether a man be honest
or dishonest, so he knows how to avoid the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>penitentiary and escape the hangman. In
like manner, the world seldom thinks it worth
while to inquire whether a man be temperate
or intemperate, prudent or thoughtless. It
takes especial care to inform itself whether
in all things he conforms to orthodox requirements;
and if he does, all is right. Thus
men too often learn to consider an oath an
absolution from all subsequent decencies and
duties, and a full release from all responsibilities.
If a husband maltreat his wife, the
offence is venal; for he premised it by making
her at the altar, an ‘honest woman.’ If
a married father neglects his children, it is a
trifle; for grace was regularly said before
they were born.</p>

<p class='c007'>“With such a world as this, it is a difficult
matter to reason. After listening to all I
have said, it may perhaps cut me short by reminding
me, that nature herself declares it
to be right and proper, that we should reproduce
our species without calculation or restraint.
I will ask, in reply, whether nature
also declares it to be right and proper, that
when the thermometer is at 96°, we should
drink greedily of cold water, and drop down
dead in the streets? Let the world be told,
that if nature gave us our passions and propensities,
she gave us also the power wisely
to control them; and that, when we hesitate
to exercise that power we descend to a level
with the brute creation, and become the sport
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>of fortune—the mere slaves of circumstance.<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c012'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“To one other argument it were not, perhaps,
worth while to advert, but that it has
been already speciously used to excite popular
prejudice. It has been said, that to recommend
to mankind prudential restraint in
cases where children cannot be provided for,
is an insult to the poor man; since all ought
to be so circumstanced that they might provide
amply for the largest family. Most assuredly
all <i>ought</i> to be so circumstanced;
but all <i>are</i> not. And there would be just as
much propriety in bidding a poor man to go
and take by force a piece of Saxony broadcloth
from his neighbor’s store, because he
<i>ought</i> to be able to purchase it, as to encourage
him to go on producing children, because
he <i>ought</i> to have the wherewithal to support
them. Let us exert every nerve to correct
the injustice and arrest the misery that results
from a vicious order of things; but, until
we have done so, let us not, for humanity’s
sake, madly recommend that which grievously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>aggravates the evil; which increases the
burden on the present generation, and threatens
with neglect and ignorance the next.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It now remains, after having spoken of
the <i>desirability</i> of obtaining control over the
instinct of reproduction, to speak of its <i>practicability</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have taken great pains to ascertain the
opinions of the most enlightened physicians of
Great Britain and France on this subject;
(opinions which popular prejudice will not
permit them to offer publicly in their works;)
and they all concur in admitting, what the
experience of the French nation <i>positively
proves</i>, that man may have a perfect control
over this instinct: and that men and women
may, without any injury to health, or the
slightest violence done to the moral feelings,
and with but small diminution to the pleasure
which accompanies the gratification of
the instinct, refrain at will from becoming
parents. It has chanced to me, also, to win
the confidence of several individuals, who
have communicated to me, without reserve,
their own experience: and all this has been
corroborative of the same opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“However various and contradictory the
different theories of generation, almost all
physiologists are agreed, that the entrance of
the sperm itself (or of some volatile particles
proceeding from it) into the uterus, must
precede conception. This it was that probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>first suggested the possibility of preventing
conception at all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The eloquent writer, who was at that time
unaware of the existence of Desomeaux’s
mode of prevention to conception,<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c012'><sup>[39]</sup></a> states
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>the same result was attained by a complete
withdrawal on the part of the male previous
to emission. But this mode, it will be readily
perceived, is attended with, to some, insurmountable
difficulties.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the first place, few men can invariably
control themselves in this respect, and to be
an effectual preventive, he must ever, and
invariably control his passions. Now it cannot
be denied, that even those who habitually
can, and do control themselves, will inevitably,
now and then, in so exciting a passion,
lose their self-control. It is impossible to do
otherwise. And one moment’s forgetfulness
defeats the end. In the second place, even
if always and invariably practicable, it makes
the act of coition incomplete and unsatisfactory.
In the third place it would be almost,
nay quite impossible, to prevent an imperceptible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>and unconscious escape of semen, sufficient
however to produce conception, often
giving rise to unjust and unfounded suspicions,
when, in fact, the cause for the existence
of pregnancy is the same as though no withdrawal
was practised. And lastly, its effects
upon the constitution are frequently not unlike
those produced by onanism. In addition
to which, it is unsafe, because uncertain;
consequently, when indispensable to prevent
pregnancy, is of no avail, if not actually dangerous.<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>To sum up, in brief, why pregnancy should
be prevented, the reasons adduced seem to
be conclusive to the able and talented writer,
in its moral, social, and physiological aspect.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Morally.</i> Firstly. It induces early marriages
by removing the principal obstacle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>thereto, viz.: the fear of having offspring
before the parents are in a pecuniary condition
to support, rear, and educate them.
And,</p>

<p class='c007'>Secondly, By inducing early marriages,
seductions would become less frequent, and
consequently prostitution, comparatively, become
extinct.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Socially.</i> Firstly. Young men, instead
of seeking excitement and amusement in the
intoxicating cup, gaming, night carousals,
brothels, &#38;c., acquiring habits of dissipation
deadening alike to the keen, fresh susceptibilities
belonging to youth—habits too, which
often cling to them in after life, habits which,
perhaps for ever destroy their health,—as
tainting their constitution with some foul and
incurable disease,—would, with a view to
early marriage, cultivate the social and domestic
ties, while yet pure and uncontaminated
by contact with the dissolute and
vicious. And</p>

<p class='c007'>Secondly, Young persons, even though
with very limited means, would nevertheless
marry, and by not becoming parents, be enabled,
unitedly, to husband their resources,
with the view to the bettering their condition
pecuniarily; in the meantime, and in the
days of their youth, enjoying all those social
endearments which each sex finds in the
society of the other, where reciprocity of
views, interests, and feelings exists. So too,
those in middling circumstances would marry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>early, merely deferring an increase of
family until they will have established themselves
in some business, ere the constant accumulating
expenses of an increasing family
encroach upon, or eat up their small capital,
the immediate incurrence of which thus early
would, perhaps, for ever destroy the means
for the comfortable provision of themselves,
as also the future welfare of their children.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Physiologically.</i> By inducing early marriages,
the dire evils arising from promiscuous
sexual intercourse with the tainted or
diseased, will gradually disappear, and in a
generation or two we would find springing
up, in the place of the present sickly, puny
race, a healthy, robust, and pure generation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In regard to the morality of preventing
conception it is contended that everything
which tends to the amelioration of mankind,
to improve their condition physically, morally,
and socially, or equalize their condition
pecuniarily, cannot be immoral. That the
instinct of reproduction should be, like our
other appetites and passions, subject to the
control of reason,—that when the gratification
of this instinct results in evil effects
either to ourselves or to our offspring, or
even to society—if such evil can be prevented,
it is the obligation of morality that it
should be.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is contended, then, that the use of a preventive
to conception will make men and
women rational, reflecting, thinking beings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>regardful alike of their own welfare and the
welfare of their offspring. That it will
banish poverty, vice and profligacy, by enabling
the poor to improve their pecuniary
condition and thus engendering habits of
frugality, reflection and economy, which the
prospect of future competency is so calculated
to inspire. Vice so often springing
from despair and hopeless poverty will disappear,
because the children, by reason of
the competence and moral structure of the
parents, will not in infancy be thrust upon
the world to mingle with the depraved and
the licentious. Sexual profligacy and licentiousness
will be checked, as early marriages
become more prevalent and universal, as
there then will exist no reasons as now, why
two persons, attached to each other, should
not marry, refraining merely from becoming
parents. Dishonorable advances therefore
would be spurned, seductions thus have no
existence, and prostitution, the offspring of
seduction, would be unknown, and even the
ravages of that disease, engendered by promiscuous
sexual intercourse, now carrying
off its tens of thousands, transmitting its pestiferous
poison to thousands yet unborn, would
entirely disappear.</p>

<p class='c007'>The able author thus concludes his views:</p>

<p class='c006'>“And now let my readers pause. Let
them review the various arguments I have
placed before them. Let them reflect how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>intimately the instinct of which I treat is
connected with the social welfare of society.
Let them bear in mind, that just in proportion
to its social influence, is it important that
we should know how to control and govern
it; that when we obtain such control, we
may save ourselves—and, what we ought to
prize much more highly, may save our companions
and our offspring, from suffering or
misery; that, by such knowledge, the young
may form virtuous connexions, instead of
becoming profligates or ascetics; that, by it,
early marriage is deprived of its heaviest
consequences, and seduction of its sharpest
sting; that, by it, man may be saved from
moral ruin, and woman from desolating dishonor;
that by it the first pure affections
may be soothed and satisfied, instead of being
thwarted or destroyed—let them call to mind
all this, and let them say, whether the possession
of such control be not a blessing to
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As to the cry which prejudice may raise
against it as being unnatural, it is just as unnatural
(and no more so) as to refrain, in a
sultry summer’s day, from drinking, perhaps,
more than a pint of water at a draught,
which prudence tells us is enough, while inclination
would bid us drink a quart. <i>All</i>
thwarting of any human wish or impulse
may, in one sense, be called unnatural; it is
not, however, ofttimes the less prudent and
proper on that account.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>As to the practical efficacy of this preventive,
the experience of France, where it
is universally practised, might suffice in
proof. We know, at this moment, several married
persons who have told us, that, after
having had as many children as they thought
prudent, <i>they had for years employed it with
perfect success</i>. For the satisfaction of our
readers, we will select some instances.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few weeks since, a respectable and
very intelligent father of a family, about
thirty-five years of age, who resides west
of the mountains, called at our office. Conversation
turned on the present subject,
and we expressed to him our conviction
that this preventive was effectual. He
told us he could speak from personal experience.
He had married young, and soon
had three children. These he could support
in comfort, without running into debt or
difficulty; but, the price of produce sinking
in his neighborhood, there did not appear a
fair prospect of supporting a large family.
In consequence, he and his wife determined
to limit their offspring to three. They have
accordingly used it for seven or eight years;
have had no more children; and have been
rewarded for their prudence by finding their
situation and prospects improving every
year.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next communication from which we
shall copy is from a young man of excellent
character, living in a neighboring state, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>now one of the conductors of a popular periodical.
After suggesting to us the propriety
of re-publishing some English works
now out of print, he proceeds as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Had I not been addressing you upon
another subject, I should not have ventured
to obtrude on you my small need of approbation;
but I cannot let slip this opportunity
of endeavoring to express how much I feel
indebted to you for its publication.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To know how I am so indebted, it is
necessary you should also know something
of my situation in life; and when it is described,
it is perhaps a description of the
situation of two-thirds of the journeymen
mechanics of this country.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been married nearly three years,
and am the father of two children. Having
nothing to depend upon but my own industry,
you will readily acknowledge that I had
reason to look forward with at least some
degree of disquietude to the prospect of an
increasing family and reduced wages: apparently
the inevitable lot of the generality
of working men.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had apparently nothing left but to let
matters take their own course, when your
valuable work made its appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I read it; and a new scene of existence
seemed to open before me. I found myself,
in this all-important matter, a free agent, and,
in a degree, the arbiter of my own destiny.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>I could have said to you as Selim said to
Hassan,—‘</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Thou’st hew’d a mountain’s weight from off my heart.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>My visions of poverty and future distress
vanished; the present seemed gilded with
new charms, and the future appeared no
longer to be dreaded. But you can better
imagine, than I describe, the revolution of
my feelings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have since endeavored to circulate
this book as widely as my limited opportunities
permit, and shall continue to do so,
believing it to be the most useful work that
has made its appearance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The next extract, from an inhabitant of
Pennsylvania, we have selected chiefly as it
furnishes a beautiful, and, alas! a rare, example,
of that parental conscientiousness which
scruples to impart existence where it cannot
also impart the conditions necessary to render
that existence happy. In this view, the
control in question is indeed all-important.
Were such virtue as this cultivated in mankind
generally, how soon might the very
seeds of disease die out among us, instead
of bearing, as now, their poison-fruit from
generation to generation! and how far might
human beings, in succeeding ages, surpass
their forefathers in strength, in health, and in
beauty!</p>

<p class='c007'>This view of the subject is to the physiologist,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>to the philosopher, to every friend
of human improvement, a most interesting
one. ‘So long,’ to use the words of an
eloquent lecturer, ‘as the tainted stream
is unhesitatingly transmitted through the
channel of nature, from parent to offspring,
so long will the text be verified which
“visits the sins of the fathers on the children,
even to the third and fourth generation.”’
And so long, we would add, will mankind—wise
and successful whenever there is question
of improving the animal races—be blind
in perceiving, and listless in securing, that
far nobler object, the physical, and thereby—in
a measure—the mental and moral improvement
of our own.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here is the extract which led to these
remarks:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was born of poor parents, and early
left an orphan. When of age, though my
circumstances promised poorly for the support
of a family, I desired to marry, knowing
that a good wife would greatly add to
my happiness. The preventive spoken of
in your book presented itself to my mind,
and for seven years that I have now been
married, it has been used. I was successful
in business, and acquired the means
of maintaining a family; but still I have
been unwilling, because my constitution is
such a one as I think a parent ought not to
transmit to his offspring. I prefer not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>to give birth to sentient beings, unless I
can give them those advantages, physical as
well as moral and intellectual, which are
essential to human happiness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From the letter of an aged French gentleman,
who holds a public office in the western
country, I translate the following; and I
would to heaven that every young man and
woman in these United States could read it:</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have read your work with much interest;
and desire that it may have a wide
circulation and that its recommendations may
be adopted in practice. If you publish another
edition, I could wish that you would
add a piece of advice of the greatest importance,
especially to young married persons.
Many women are ignorant, that, in the gratification
of the re-productive instinct, the
exhaustion to the man is much greater than
to the woman; a fact most important to be
known, the ignorance of which has caused
more than one husband to forfeit his health,
nay, his life. Tissot tells us, that the loss by
an ounce of semen is equal to that by forty
ounces of blood;<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a> and that, in the case of the

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>“How many young spouses, loving their
husbands tenderly and disinterestedly, if
they were but informed of these facts, would
watch over and preserve their partners’
healths, instead of exciting them to over-indulgence.”—Another
extract.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A member of the Society of Friends,
from the country, called at our office; he informed
me that he had been married twenty
years, had six children, and would probably
have had twice as many, but for the preventive,
which he found in every instance efficacious.
By this means he made an interval
of two or three years between the births of
each of his children. Having at last a family
of six, his wife earnestly desired to have
no more; and on one occasion, when the
preventive was neglected to be used, she
shed tears at the prospect of again becoming
pregnant. He said he knew, in
his own neighborhood, several married women
who were rendered miserable on account
of their continued pregnancy, and
would have given anything in the world to
escape, but knew not how.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Our readers may implicitly depend on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>accuracy of the facts we have stated. Though
in the present state of public opinion we may
not, for obvious reasons, give <i>names</i> in proof.</p>

<p class='c007'>That most practical of philosophers,
Franklin, interprets chastity to mean, <i>the regulated
and strictly temperate satisfaction,
without injury to others, of those desires
which are natural to all healthy adult beings</i>.
In this sense, chastity is the first of virtues,
and one most rarely practised, either by
young men or by married persons, even
when the latter most scrupulously conform
to the letter of the law.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is all important for the welfare of our race,
that the re-productive instinct should never be
selfishly indulged; never gratified at the expense
of the well-being of our companions.
A man who, in this matter, will not consult,
with scrupulous deference, the slightest
wishes of the other sex; a man who will
ever put his desires in competition with
theirs, and who will prize more highly the
pleasure he receives than that he may be
capable of bestowing—such a man appears
to me, in the essentials of character, a brute.
The brutes commonly seek the satisfaction
of their propensities with straight-forward
selfishness, and never calculate whether their
companions are gratified or teased by their
importunities. Man cannot assimilate his
nature more closely to theirs, than by imitating
them in this.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again. There is no instinct in regard to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>which strict temperance is more essential.
All our animal desires have hitherto occupied
an undue share of human thoughts; but
none more generally than this. The imaginations
of the young and the passions of the
adult are inflamed by mystery or excited by
restraint, and a full half of all the thoughts
and intrigues of the world has a direct reference
to this single instinct. Even those,
who like the Shakers, ‘crucify the flesh,’ are
not the less occupied by it in their secret
thoughts; as the Shaker writings themselves
may afford proof. Neither human institutions
nor human prejudices can destroy the
instinct. Strange it is, that men should not
be content rationally to control, and wisely
to regulate it.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>SEXUAL WEAKNESS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This complaint, commonly called <i>fluor
albus</i>, or <i>whites</i>, to which women are peculiarly
subject, must form an important object
of attention, since it is always attended with
disagreeable symptoms; and, when aggravated,
soon spoils the beauty of a fine face,
weakens the digestive powers, produces a
general bad habit, and occasions sterility.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Symptoms.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>An irregular discharge from the passage
leading to the womb, of a fluid, which, in
different women, varies much in colour, being
of a white, green, yellow, or brown hue. In
the beginning it is, however, most usually
white and pellucid, and, in progress of the
complaint, acquires the various discolourations
and different degrees of acrimony,
whence proceed a slight smarting on making
water. Besides the discharge, the patient is
frequently afflicted with severe and constant
pains in the back and loins, indigestion, paleness
of the face, chilliness, and languor. In
process of time, every symptom becomes
highly aggravated, the feet and ankles swell,
palpitations, and a difficulty of respiration
are experienced, the menstrual discharge is
rendered irregular, the urine is turbid, the
mind is dejected, and either consumption or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>dropsy supervenes, and terminates a miserable
existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some languid habits, the fluor albus
returns periodically, instead of the proper
menstrual evacuation, until the patient’s constitution
is duly invigorated.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Causes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>It may be produced by any cause which
either weakens or irritates the womb and
its appendages. It may arise from general
debility of the constitution, but it is especially
caused by circumstances impairing the power
of the womb itself, as, for instance, a severe
labour, a miscarriage, or profuse menstruation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some instances it appears to depend on
a full and irritable habit of body, and, in
other cases, of local irritation, such as disorders
of the womb, or of the urinary organs,
or a collection in the gut, of the small thready
worms called ascarides.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the high authority of Dr. Hamilton,
this disease is most frequently first brought
on by some imprudence in respect to diet
and clothing, or exposure to cold or fatigue,
or neglect of the bowels about the time when
menstruation begins.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Treatment.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>In the treatment of this complaint regard
must be had to the apparent cause, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>the state of the patient. The discharge is
too often considered by the sex as the effects
of general weakness in their habit, and, therefore,
they are led to the indiscriminate use of
heating medicines, as port wine, balsam copaibæ,
&#38;c., without paying attention to the
habit of the body, or cause of the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>A milk diet, change of air, and the partial
cold bath, as sponging the loins and thighs
with cold water every morning, with attention
to cleanliness and proper exercise, are
often sufficient to arrest the disease, if early
adopted.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to this plan of treatment, if the
patient be of a full habit, a disposition to fever
from slight causes, attended with a sense of
heat about the passage to the womb, it will be
necessary to have recourse to the lancet,
cooling cathartics, and febrifuge medicines,
and to inject, several times a day, flax-seed
tea or milk and water, into the passage of the
womb. In the great majority of cases, the
complaint arises from general debility or laxity
of the vessels of the parts, and in such cases
the indications of cure are to increase the
vital heat, promote the digestion, and restrain
the preternatural discharge. In order to
which, recourse must be had to such of the
tonic medicines as will be found to agree
best with the patient. Of these, the bark
and elixir vitriol, the tonic powders or pills,
the rust or tincture of steel, and lime-water
have usually been employed, and often with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>good effects. In some instances, however, I
have known these medicines to fail, when
the nitric acid, diluted, in doses of a wineglassful,
three or four times a day, wonderfully
succeeded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Previously to the exhibition of tonic medicines,
it is advisable to give a dose of ipecacuanha
or antimonial wine. Gentle emetics
are supposed to be of singular utility in this
complaint, not only by cleansing the stomach
and bowels, and making a revulsion of the
humors from the inferior part of the body,
but likewise by their exciting all the powers
of the constitution to a more vigorous
action.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bowels must be kept in a regular state
by conjoining a few grains of rhubarb with
some of the tonic medicines, or by taking
occasionally, at bedtime, one of the aloetic,
or aperient or diaphoretic pills; or, in the
morning, a teaspoonful of Epsom salts dissolved
in a tumbler of water.</p>

<p class='c007'>If there be a fulness of the stomach after
eating, the tincture of rhubarb in small doses
will excite digestion. In obstinate cases, it
is often expedient to produce a change in the
system, by giving a grain or two of calomel,
or one of the mercurial pills at bedtime,
until the gums become slightly affected, and
then the cure may be completed by strengthening
medicines, together with the shower
bath.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides tonics, stimulating medicines, such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>as commonly determine to the urinary passages,
have very frequently been employed
with great benefit. Of these, rosin in doses
of ten grains in the yolk of an egg, or a
spoonful of molasses, or balsam copaibæ in
doses of a teaspoonful, or tincture of cantharides
in doses of twenty or thirty drops
in some mucilaginous drink, and taken three
or four times a day, will be found most salutary.</p>

<p class='c007'>These means strike at the cause of the
complaint; but if it do not remove the effect
very soon, we are not to trust to them alone.
For once a morbid secretion being excited,
it is very apt to continue, although the exciting
cause cease to operate.</p>

<p class='c007'>On this account, we ought, without delay,
to have recourse to astringent injections,
such as a strong decoction of red oak bark,
with the addition of a little alum or a solution
of alum in water. Half an ounce of the
former to be dissolved in a bottle of water;
which should be thrown into the vagina by
means of a female syringe, two or three times
a day. The celebrated Dr. Burns says,
after many trials, he satisfied himself, that
although assistance may be derived from internal
medicines and the cold bath, yet the
chief dependence is to be placed on astringent
applications to the seat of the discharge;
and these, where there is no fulness of the
general system, nor any affection of the womb
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>itself, are perfectly safe, and seldom fail in
producing a cure.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be prudent, when this disease occurs
as an early symptom of pregnancy, not to
check the discharge suddenly, lest miscarriage
be the consequence; but it may be
moderated by injections of water, with the
addition of a little vinegar, or an infusion of
green tea. Neither should the discharge be
suddenly suppressed when it has been of long
standing, and acquired a considerable degree
of acrimony, with an offensive smell. For if
it be unseasonably checked, the belly swells,
and a train of the most disagreeable symptoms
occurs. In such cases, soap suds, or an
infusion of chamomile flowers or hops, should
be frequently thrown up the vagina; and, as
soon as the blood is freed of its impurities, by
suitable medicines, and has recovered, in some
measure, its soft and balmy quality of which
it has been deprived, the astringent injections
may be employed with perfect safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>The application of a blister to the sacrum,
has, in some obstinate cases, been attended
with advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the fluor albus proceeds from worms,
purgatives and bitter clysters are the proper
remedies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pain in the back and loins is often mitigated
by the application of a large adhesive or
strengthening plaster, and by avoiding a
standing posture of long continuance, much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>walking, dancing, or any other violent exertion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Women should carefully avoid all the remote
causes of the disease: they should pay
diligent attention to cleanliness, by washing
the parts frequently with cold water; and
when there are excoriations, milk and water,
or lead water, may be employed as a wash.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Regimen.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The diet should be light, cordial, and nourishing,
consisting of isinglass dissolved in
milk by boiling it, jellies, custards, rice, milk,
soft-boiled eggs, gelatinous broths, and light
meats, together with a prudent use of genuine
wine, particularly claret or port.</p>

<p class='c007'>Women, affected with this disease, should
by no means indulge in the use of tea and
other warm slops of a relaxing nature; but
should lie on a mattress in preference to a
feather bed; and they should rise early, and
take such daily exercise as their strength will
admit, particularly on horseback. When
there is much languor, with chilliness, friction
with the flesh-brush, and wearing flannel
next the skin, must not be omitted.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>FALLING DOWN OF THE WOMB.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This is a much more common complaint
than the former, and takes place in women
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>of every age, and every rank. As its name
implies, it consists of change in the situation
of the womb, by which that organ lies much
lower than it ought to do. In some cases it
absolutely protrudes entirely without the
parts. The slightest degrees are styled bearing
down; and the more violent ones descent
or falling down of the womb.</p>

<p class='c007'>In general, the first symptom of this complaint
is an uneasy sensation in the lower part
of the back while standing or walking, with
now and then a kind of pressure and bearing
down.</p>

<p class='c007'>If these feelings be disregarded, the complaint
increases, and the patient becomes incapable
of making water without first lying
down, or pushing up a swelling which seems
to stop the discharge of urine; and if the
disease continues to increase, the womb is actually
forced out of the parts, and takes on
the form of a bulky substance hanging down
between the thighs. This extreme degree
of the complaint can seldom happen, excepting
in women who have had a great many
children, but the less degrees of it occur occasionally
in very young unmarried women.</p>

<p class='c007'>The causes of descent of the womb ought
to be known to every woman, as many of
them may be avoided. Every disease which
induces weakness of the habit in general, or
of the passage leading to the womb, in particular,
must lay the foundation for the complaint.
Frequent miscarriages, improper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>treatment during labour, too early or violent
exercise after delivery, are in married women,
the most frequent circumstances by
which falling down of the womb is produced.
In the unmarried, it is apt to take place in
consequence of violent exercise, as in dancing,
riding, &#38;c., while out of order, a fact
that ought to be impressed on the mind of
every young woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the treatment of this complaint, the
means must be adapted to the degree of its
violence. When the descent is inconsiderable,
and the case is of recent date, the daily
use of the cold bath, invigorating diet, very
moderate exercise, and the injection of any
mild astringent liquor into the passage, evening
and morning, will probably prove successful.
But should the disease be in a great
degree or of long standing, a course of tonics,
with the frequent use of astringent injections,
as a strong solution of alum in water, or decoction
of red oak bark, must be added to
the above means.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Leak advises, that after the parts are
reduced, the intention of contracting the relaxed
vagina so as to prevent its future descent,
may be effected by the frequent use
of the following astringent injection. Take
of alum, and white vitriol, each, one drachm,
boiling water, one pound, mix and filter
through paper. Inject it into the vagina,
milk warm, with a womb syringe. At the
same time endeavour to strengthen the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>bodily system by nourishing diet, and tonic
medicines.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the complaint resists such remedies,
or when, from its degree, it may appear unnecessary
to employ them, the only relief
which can be afforded, unless the womb become
pregnant, is to be obtained by wearing
an instrument called a pessary. It is made
of wood or ivory, and if properly adapted to
the passage, and of a proper construction, it
can be worn without much inconvenience,
and it never occasions pain. Certain attentions
are however necessary, whenever such
an instrument is used. Thus, the pessary
should never be allowed to remain in the
passage above a few days at a time, otherwise
it becomes the source of great irritation.
It should, therefore, be occasionally withdrawn
on going to bed, well cleaned and reintroduced
in the morning, before the patient
rises. In some instances, after a pessary of
a certain size has been worn for several
months, one of a smaller size becomes better
adapted to the passages, and in other cases
one of a larger size is required.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sponges of such a size as, when expanded,
fill up the cavity of the vagina, are very good
<i>pessaries</i>. They support the uterus, and, by
putting a string through them, the end of
which is to be left hanging out of the os externum,
the woman can take them away and
apply them herself very conveniently.</p>

<p class='c007'>To answer this purpose, a fine sponge,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>wrung out in alum water, may be dried in a
compressed state, and cut into any convenient
form, so as to be introduced as high as
possible: this will act by its astringency, and
by its pressure, in a gentle and uniform manner.
During the use of this application, an
astringent injection may be used twice a day;
and the sponge tent should be made gradually
smaller as the vagina contracts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The application of the bandage round the
whole belly, with a moderate degree of firmness,
often gives great relief to the uneasy
feelings. The T bandage has also been
worn in this case with considerable advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a woman liable to falling down of the
womb, become pregnant, there is no occasion
for the pessary after the third month, and by
proper treatment after delivery, the return
of the complaint may be prevented.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>MISCARRIAGE OR ABORTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We now come to the consideration of a
subject, in respect to which there exists much
misapprehension and ignorance, causing useless
and unnecessary alarm and anxiety to
those who may be so unfortunate as to be
subject, at particular periods of gestation, to
abortion or miscarriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dangers of abortion or miscarriage
are often magnified and exaggerated. It is
dangerous if produced by a fall, a blow, a
kick from a horse, or any other external bodily
violence or injury, causing internal contusion,
or rupture of some blood-vessels;
and, also, but not to the same extent, if produced
by sudden fright, violent fits of passion,
&#38;c., or from general debility or disease of
the uterus; but the danger arises more from
the cause which produces the miscarriage,
than from the miscarriage itself; as it is well
known by those versed in obstetrics that,
where it is deemed indispensable to effect a
miscarriage, either because of the existence
of a deformed pelvis, diseased uterus, or
other causes, if skilfully effected, it is attended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>with no danger, especially in the earlier
stages of pregnancy.<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Symptoms.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>When miscarriage is about to take place,
its first symptoms are generally occasional
stinging pains at the bottom of the belly, extending
across and around the loins and hips;
a feeling of fatigue of the legs, pain in the
forehead, burning sensation of the eyes. The
breasts, which before were distended, become
soft and flabby, hot and cold flashes, attended
with thirst, fever, and shiverings. In a day
or two after the appearance of these symptoms,
a discharge from the womb takes place
of yellow matter, tinctured with red. If not
arrested at this stage, the pains across the
loins become more severe and frequent, attended
with a sense of dead weight, and
bearing down about the womb, the water is
discharged, and the expulsion of the contents
of the womb takes place. The symptoms of
miscarriage, however, vary with the causes
which produce them, or the state of habit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>age, or health of the patient; some recovering
immediately, and rapidly, and with but
little inconvenience. Where miscarriage
arises from a serious accident, such as violent
falls, bruises, &#38;.c., the symptoms are
somewhat aggravated, and more severe, and
are often preceded and accompanied with
violent and profuse floodings and discharges
of coagula, in addition to the other symptoms;
although moderate flowing is not an
unfrequent symptom in miscarriages.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is always accompanied with two circumstances,
separation of the membranous
bag, and expulsive efforts or contraction of the
womb itself. The first is productive of discharge,
the second of pains like those of
labor. Sometimes the separation or detachment
of part of the conception takes
place before any pain is felt; on other occasions,
the pain, or contraction of the womb,
takes place first, and produces a separation.
In the first of these cases, the symptoms of
abortion take place suddenly, and are usually
occasioned by fatigue, sudden exertion, or
fright. In the second, the pains come on,
and there are particular feelings, and changes,
which indicate that a miscarriage is likely to
take place; as, for instance, the cessation of
the morning sickness, the subsidence of the
breasts, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miscarriage is preceded by floodings, pains
in the back, loins, and lower part of the abdomen,
evacuation of the water, shiverings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>palpitation of the heart, nausea, anxiety,
fainting, subsiding of the breasts and belly,
pain in the inside of the thighs, opening and
moisture of the womb.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Causes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The principal causes of miscarriage are
blows or falls; great exertion or fatigue;
sudden frights and other violent emotions of
the mind; a diet too sparing or too nutritious;
the abuse of spirituous liquors; other
diseases, particularly fevers and hæmorrhages;
likewise excessive bleeding, profuse
diarrhœa or colic, particularly from accumulated
fæces; immoderate venery, &#38;c.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Treatment.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>When a woman is threatened with a miscarriage,
there are two objects to attend to;
the first is, to prevent it if we can; the second
is to manage it so that as little blood as possible
be lost; and both these are obtained by
the same means. With this view, the patient
should immediately, on the first alarm, undress
and go to bed, lightly covered, with a
firm determination not to rise till the process
be either checked or completely over. There
should be little fire in the room, though it
be winter; and in summer, the windows
must be opened. Cloths wet with cold water,
should instantly be applied to the lower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>part of the belly, and back: the drink must
be cold, and everything stimulating should
carefully be avoided.</p>

<p class='c007'>In robust habits, or when the symptoms
have been brought on suddenly by some such
cause as a fall or exertion, it is proper to
bleed; and, in cases of sickness or great feebleness,
to give a dose of laudanum; or,
what is better, to administer the anodyne
clysters.<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c012'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Opiates are useful in every case where we
hope to prevent abortion, and must be repeated
more often or seldom, according to
the effect they produce. They are, however,
improper in those cases where miscarriages
must decidedly take place. Their tendency
to occasion costiveness, when employed, must
be obviated by clysters, or some gentle laxative
medicine, such as calcined magnesia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Epsom salts, or a little castor oil. If there
be a continued but trifling discharge, great
advantage may be derived from injecting,
three or four times a day, up the vagina, a
solution of alum. Indeed, in all protracted
cases, this is of much benefit. The solution
ought to be thrown up pretty high, that it
may reach the womb.</p>

<p class='c007'>When these means produce not the desired
effect, and along with the discharge of blood
large clots come off attended with bearing
down or pains in the back and loins, especially
if the symptoms which precede abortion
have appeared, there must be every
probability that the threatening event cannot
be avoided; then we must conduct the patient
through the process.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all cases during the last stage of pregnancy,
where our endeavors to stop or repress
the hemorrhage prove abortive, it will
be advisable to deliver her as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the whole conception come away
at once, the pain and discharge usually go
off; but, if only the fœtus come away, all the
symptoms either continue and increase till
the placenta come away, or, if they be
for a time suspended, they are sure to return,
except in early miscarriages of ten
or twelve weeks pregnancy, when sometimes
the fœtus is expelled separately, and
the placenta comes immediately after, but
the latter frequently remains several days.
The most prudent mode in such cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>is to leave it to nature, which sooner or later
expels this foreign body.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the process is over, if the discharge
be profuse, and do not stop on the application
of cold water to the lower part of the
belly, it will be proper to plug up the vagina,
and this is best done by taking a piece of soft
sponge, dipping it in sweet oil, and then
wringing it gently. This is to be introduced
with the finger, portion after portion, until
the lower part of the vagina be well filled.
The remainder is then to be firmly pressed
on the orifice; and held there some time for
the effused blood to coagulate. In obstinate
cases, previously to the introduction of the
plug, we may insert a little pounded ice, or
snow tied up in a rag, if to be procured,<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a> but
neither of these should be continued so long
as to produce pain or much shivering. In
addition to this mode of treatment, it will be
advisable to have recourse to the astringent
medicines, as advised under the head of <i>Immoderate
Flow of Menses</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Regimen.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Arrow-root, tapioca, sago, panada, or rice
milk, constitute a proper regimen. If the
process be protracted, and the strength much
impaired, the diet may be more liberal. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>every case, ripe fruit is safe and useful. The
bowels are to be kept regular, and sleep, if
necessary, is to be procured by an anodyne.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Prevention.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>It requires great attention to prevent abortion
in subsequent pregnancies, whenever it
has happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all such cases, it will be highly necessary
to attend to the usual habitudes and constitution
of the woman, and to remove that
condition which is found to dispose to abortion.</p>

<p class='c007'>A woman that is subject to miscarriage,
and who is of a full plethoric habit, ought to
take the tincture of foxglove, twice or thrice
a day, for two or three weeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>She should likewise keep her body perfectly
open with gentle aperient medicines,
use a spare diet, and avoid all agitations of
the mind. The sleep should be abridged in
quantity, and taken on a mattress, instead of
a feather bed. Regular and moderate exercise
should be taken daily, being cautious, at
the same time, not to carry it to the length of
exciting fatigue.</p>

<p class='c007'>In women of a weak, lax habit, a nutritive
and generous diet, moderate exercise, and
tonic medicines, will be required. And,
along with nourishing diet, a moderate use of
wine should be allowed, if it do not heat the
patient, or otherwise disagree. The cold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>bath is of signal service in every instance
where it is not followed by chilliness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Until gestation be far advanced, it would
be advisable for the woman to sleep alone,
and strictly avoid every cause which is ascertained
to be capable of producing abortion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Women more frequently miscarry in the
second or third month than at any other
time; but some have a certain period at
which they usually go wrong, and do not
vary a week from it. In such cases, the woman
should confine herself to the house,
avoid the least exercise, and frequently recline
on the sofa or bed, till that period be
past.</p>

<p class='c007'>When a female has suffered several abortions,
it becomes almost impossible to prevent
a repetition at the same period of gestation
in a subsequent pregnancy. Nothing, however,
will be so successful in preventing a
recurrence of a similar misfortune, as in allowing
the uterine vessels to recover their
tone; for which purpose tonics must be given.
Attend to particular symptoms as they occur;
with proper diet and exercise. <i>Sea
Bathing</i> and the <i>shower bath</i> are both excellent.<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c012'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

  <h3 class='c015'><i>When necessary to effect Miscarriage or Artificial Delivery.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>During pregnancy, deformities of the pelvis
become objects of solicitude to the accoucheur,
when they are of such a character
as to render delivery at full term impossible
without the interference of cutting operations.
At this period only can he guard against the
deplorable consequences of these deformities.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Pelvic Deformities.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The accoucheur may be consulted by a
mother anxious to know whether the pelvis
of her daughter is such as to justify marriage.
His opinion may also be desired by a female
pregnant for the first time, in whose mind
there may exist fears as to the formation of
her pelvis. In this case, he will have to reply
to the following questions:</p>

<p class='c007'>Is delivery at full term compatible with the
safety of the child? What influence will
the deformity have on pregnancy? What
precautions are necessary to guard against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>accident until the completion of gestation,
and to facilitate delivery?</p>

<p class='c007'>When the accoucheur states that delivery
will not be possible without the interference
of art, he will then be asked whether this interference
will compromise the life of the
mother or child; and whether this operation
cannot be avoided by some process during
pregnancy, either saving the life of mother
and child, or sacrificing the child for the
benefit of the mother?</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to answer these questions satisfactorily,
and to furnish himself with a rule
of conduct in advance, it will be necessary
for the accoucheur to know precisely the
condition of the pelvis, and the dimensions of
the diameters, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, it must not be supposed that
this mensuration can be made with mathematical
accuracy; our means will not enable
us to obtain this precision; but even if we
could, the object we have in view would not
be completely accomplished, for, in order to
arrive at a rigorous appreciation of the consequences
of the deformity and the operations
it might require, it would be necessary also
to know the exact size of the fœtus, which is
not possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Happily, in practice, an approximation as
to the absolute condition of the pelvis will
suffice, and it is easy to arrive at this result.
With this view, the accoucheur should, in the
first place, learn the previous history of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>patient in infancy and youth, and afterward
proceed to an external and internal examination.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the accoucheur is called upon to
pass an opinion as to the natural or unnatural
conformation of a female, he should, says
M. P. Dubois, inquire minutely into the antecedent
condition of this woman during her
infancy and youth. The history of early
life will often, of itself, cause him to suspect
the state of the pelvis. He should address
the following questions to the parent:</p>

<p class='c007'><i>What diseases was the infant affected with?
At what age did they manifest themselves?
At what age did the child walk? After
walking, did it appear weak in the inferior
extremities? Was the erect position possible?
Was it easy? Were the articulations
large?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>If all these phenomena appeared in infancy,
it is highly probable that the pelvis is
deformed; and, moreover, it may be affirmed
that the symptoms arose from rickets, a
disease peculiar to infancy. It commences
rarely before eighteen or twenty months, and
very seldom after thirteen of fourteen years
of age. If there should be curvatures of the
spinal column and extremities, it will be
almost certain that the pelvis is deformed;
and if the curvature commenced in the inferior
extremities, we may conclude that it is
owing to rachitis, for this disease exerts its
influence first on the tibias, then on the bones
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>of the thighs, pelvis, and vertebral column.
On the contrary, if the first ten years have
been passed without disturbance of the general
health, then curvatures must be attributed
to malacosteon, especially if the curvature of
the spine has preceded that of the lower
limbs. Deformity of the spine may exist
alone; then we may legitimately hope that
the pelvis is not contracted. Experience, indeed,
proves that the vertebral column may
be considerably curved without the pelvis
participating in the deformity, when the inferior
extremities are straight; and that, in
general, curvatures of the extremities alone
accompany pelvic malformations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Indeed, it is not on simple probabilities
that the accoucheur is to interdict the marriage<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a>
of a young girl, or determine, during
pregnancy, to perform an operation, with the
view of protecting the mother against the
dangers of delivery at full term.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Premature Artificial Delivery.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Thanks to the efforts of MM. Stoltz,
Dezeimeris, P. Dubois, and Velpeau, delivery
brought on before the full term is an operation
hereafter recognised in French midwifery.
For a long time it proved useful to
our neighbors in England and Germany,
while a foolish prejudice caused it to be rejected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>by French practitioners, who did not
hesitate even to have recourse to the Cæsarean
section and symphyscotomy.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have not within the walls of Paris one
solitary example of a woman who had survived
the Cæsarean section. She who lived
the longest was one of those on whom I assisted
M. P. Dubois to operate. She died
on the seventeenth day of a tetanic affection,
when everything promised a most successful
result.—(<cite>Bull. of the Acad. of Med.</cite>, t. iii.,
p. 694; t. v., p. 25.)</p>

<p class='c007'>When the contraction is such that a
living fœtus cannot be brought forth, the
accoucheur has then to choose between the
Cæsarean section or miscarriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>During pregnancy, abortion will present
an extreme and last resource. And it would
seem more humane to sacrifice, before the
period of viability, an embryo whose existence
is so uncertain, in order to protect the
mother from the perilous chances of symphyscotomy
and the Cæsarean section.</p>

<p class='c007'>I must confess that, if such an alternative
were presented to me, the diameter of the
pelvis being only two inches, I should not
hesitate to propose this means.</p>

<p class='c007'>The abuse and criminal extension of such
a resource is reprehensible, but not its proper
and authorized employment. This operation
should always be undertaken with
great care, and all necessary precaution used
to satisfy the public mind of its necessity.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>LABOR, DELIVERY, ETC.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>After seven months of pregnancy the
fœtus has all the conditions for breathing and
exercising its digestion. It may then be separated
from its mother, and change its mode
of existence. Child-birth rarely, however,
happens at this period: most frequently the
fœtus remains two months longer in the
uterus, and it does not pass out of this organ
till after the revolution of nine months.</p>

<p class='c007'>Examples are related of children being
born after ten full months of gestation; but
these cases are very doubtful, for it is extremely
difficult to know the exact period of
conception. The legislation in France, however,
has fixed the principle, that child-birth
may take place up to the two hundred and
ninety-ninth day of pregnancy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing is more curious than the mechanism
by which the fœtus is expelled; everything
happens with wonderful precision; all
seems to have been foreseen, and calculated
to favor its passage through the pelvis and
the genital parts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The physical causes that determine the
exit of the fœtus are the contraction of the
uterus and that of the abdominal muscles;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>by their force the liquor amnii flows out, the
head of the fœtus is engaged in the pelvis, it
goes through it, and soon passes out by the
valve, the folds of which disappear; these
different phenomena take place in succession,
and continue a certain time; they are accompanied
with pains more or less severe;
with swelling and softening of the soft parts
of the pelvis and external genital parts, and
with an abundant mucous secretion in the
cavity of the vagina. All these circumstances,
each in its own way, favor the passage
of the fœtus. To facilitate the study of this
action, it may be divided into several periods.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The first period of child-birth.</i>—It is constituted
by the precursory signs. Two or
three days before child-birth a flow of mucus
takes place from the vagina, the external
genital parts swell and become softer; it is
the same with the ligaments that unite the
bones of the pelvis; the mouth of the womb
flattens, its opening is enlarged, its edges
become thinner; slight pains, known under
the name of <i>flying pains</i>, are felt in the loins
and abdomen.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Second period.</i>—Pains of a peculiar kind
come on; they begin in the lumbar region,
and seem to be propagated towards the
womb or the <i>rectum</i>; and are renewed only
after intervals of a quarter or half an hour
each. Each of them is accompanied with an
evident contraction of the body of the uterus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>with tension of its neck and dilatation of the
opening; the finger directed into the vagina
discovers that the envelopes of the fœtus
are pushed outward, and that there is a considerable
tumor, which is called <i>the waters</i>;
the pains very soon become stronger, and
the contraction of the uterus more powerful;
the membranes break, and a part of the
liquid escapes; the uterus contracts on
itself, and is applied to the surface of the
fœtus.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Third period.</i>—The pains and contractions
of the uterus increase considerably;
they are instinctively accompanied by the
contraction of the abdominal muscles. The
woman who is aware of their effect is inclined
to favour them, by making all the
muscular efforts of which she is capable:
her pulse then becomes stronger and more
frequent; her face is animated, her eyes
shine, her whole body is in extreme agitation,
and perspiration flows in abundance.
The head descends into the lower strait of
the pelvis.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fourth period.</i>—After some moments of
repose the pains and expulsive contractions
resume all their activity; the head presents
itself at the vulva, makes an effort to pass,
and succeeds when there happens to be a
contraction sufficiently strong to produce
this effect. The head being once disengaged,
the remaining parts of the body easily
follow, on account of their smaller volume.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>The section of the umbilical cord is then
made, and a ligature is put around it at a
short distance from the umbilicus or navel.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fifth period.</i>—If the midwife has not proceeded
immediately to the extraction of the
placenta after the birth of the child, slight
pains are felt in a short time, the uterus contracts
freely, but with force enough to throw
off the placenta and the membranes of the
ovum; this expulsion bears the name of <i>delivery</i>.
During the twelve or fifteen days
that follow child-birth the uterus contracts
by degrees upon itself, the woman suffers
abundant perspirations, her breasts are extended
by the milk that they secrete; a flow
of matter, which takes place from the vagina,
called <i>lochia</i>, first sanguiferous, then
whitish, indicates that the organs of the
woman resume, by degrees, the disposition
they had before conception.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>MANAGEMENT OF LABOR.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Women in general are ignorant of parturition
or delivery. Almost all of them are
under the impression that labor is completed
more by art than nature; hence the most
noted accoucheurs are employed to attend
during this interesting period; and professional
men, in general, have no wish to undeceive
them on this subject, as their interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>is too much concerned. It is often astonishing
to see the credulity and ignorance manifested
on these occasions. Thanks and
blessings have been poured forth, under the
idea that he had saved their lives in labor,
when the accoucheur had merely looked on
and admired the perfectly adequate powers
of nature, and superintended the efforts of
her work; and it is nature that accomplishes
all, while the accoucheur gets the credit
of it. There is not one case in a thousand
in which he can do more than remain a silent
spectator, except to calm the fears of
the ignorant and timid attendants. The
mischief and injury that are done by the untimely
interference of art are incalculable.</p>

<p class='c007'>In pregnancy women are bled till they
have not strength enough to accomplish delivery;
and, when it takes place, the forceps
or other instruments are used, which often
prove fatal to the mother or child, or both.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are various particulars to be avoided,
and several things to be done, in the
management of women during labor. We
have room here to state only a few, and shall
begin by pointing out the course to be pursued
in</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Natural Labor.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>When called to a woman supposed to be in
labor, ascertain if her pains are <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>,
which may be easily known by a little inquiry.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>If the female complains of flying or unsettled
pains about the system, occurring
mostly toward evening or during the night,
and being slight or irregular, it may be taken
for granted that they are spurious or false.
If these symptoms prove troublesome, an
infusion or tea of <i>hops</i> may be taken; or, if
this is not sufficient to relieve them, or procure
sleep, an anodyne may be taken; and
it may be necessary also to give laxative
medicines or an injection, with a little laudanum.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>True pains</i> may be known by the pain
being more concentrated in the lower part
of the belly, through the loins and hips.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pains now increase in regularity and
force, returning every ten or fifteen minutes,
and leaving the woman comparatively easy
in the intervals.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the pains become regular and severe,
there is a discharge of slimy matter,
tinged with blood, known by the name of
<i>shows</i>. At this period of labor it will be
proper for the person who attends the labor
to examine, in order to ascertain what part
of the child presents, which may be done by
requesting the female to sit in the chair or
on the side of the bed, and to extend the legs,
when the longest finger, dipped in sweet oil,
may be passed up the vagina to the part
which presents, and the sense communicated
will determine the nature of the presentation.
In nineteen cases out of twenty, or in almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>every case, the head will be felt. Frequent
examinations should be avoided.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Bard, speaking of examinations, remarks:
“What terms shall I use to condemn,
as it deserves, the abominable practice of boring,
scooping, and stretching the soft parts
of the mother, under the preposterous idea
of making room for the child to pass. It is
impossible to censure this dangerous practice
too severely; it is always wrong; nor can
there be any one period in labor, the most
easy and natural, the most tedious and difficult,
the most regular or preternatural in
which it can be of the least use; in which it
will not unavoidably do great mischief: it
will render an easy labor painful; one which
would be short, tedious; and one which, if
left to nature, would terminate happily, highly
dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All that is proper to be done in a case of
natural labor, from its commencement to its
termination,” says Dr. McNair, “will suggest
itself to any person of common understanding;
and I have long labored under the conviction,
that the office of attending women
in their confinement should be intrusted to
prudent females. There is not, according
to my experience, and the reports of the
most eminent surgeons, more than one case
in three thousand that requires the least assistance.
I am aware, however, that there
are crafty physicians who attempt, and often
succeed, in causing the distressed and alarmed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>female to believe that it would be altogether
impossible for her to get over her troubles
without their assistance; and, for the purpose
of making it appear that their services are
absolutely necessary, they will be continually
interfering, sometimes with their instruments,
when there is not the least occasion for it.
There is no doubt in my mind but that one-half
of the women attended by these men
are delivered before their proper period; and
this is the reason why we see so many deformed
children, and meet with so many females
who have incurable complaints.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a very common circumstance for an inexperienced
(or he may be an experienced, but
ignorant) practitioner to attempt a rupture of
the membranes, and in doing so, rupture the
bladder, which would render the woman miserable
during life. We are acquainted with
twenty-five or thirty females who have met
with this sad misfortune, and many of them
have been attended by those who are termed
our most successful, or old experienced physicians.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Rush, speaking of child-bearing among
the Indians, says, “that nature is their only
<i>midwife</i>; their labors are short and accompanied
with little pain; each woman is delivered
in a private cabin, without so much
as one of her own sex to attend her: after
washing herself in cold water, she returns in
a few days to her usual employment; so that
she knows nothing of those accidents which
proceed from the carelessness or ill management
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>of <i>midwives</i> or doctors, or the weakness
which arises from a month’s confinement in
a warm room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Whitney remarks; “I have had many
cases where I found the attendants alarmed,
and some in tears, from supposing that they
should have had help sooner, fearing the
worst consequence from delay; but, admitting
that the ‘doctor knew best,’ they would
wait calmly for hours, when in nature’s time
all ended well. I pledge myself as a physician,
that all honest doctors will tell you that
<i>labor</i> is the work of <i>nature</i>, and she generally
does it <i>best</i> when left to herself.”<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c012'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“Among the Araucanian Indians,” says
Stevenson in his Twenty Years’ Residence
in South America, “a mother, immediately
on her delivery, takes her child, and going
down to the nearest stream, washes herself
and it, and returns to the usual labor of her
station.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The wonderful facility with which the
Indian women bring forth their children,”
say Lewis and Clark in their well known
journal, “seems rather some benevolent gift
of nature, in exempting them from pains
which their savage state would render
doubly grievous, than any result of habit.
One of the women who had been leading
two of our pack horses, halted at a rivulet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>about a mile behind, and sent on the two
horses by a female friend. On enquiring of
one of the Indian men the cause of her detention,
he answered, with great appearance
of unconcern, that she had just stopped to
lie in, and would soon overtake us. In fact,
we were astonished to see her in about an
hour’s time come on with her new-born infant,
and pass us on her way to the camp,
apparently in perfect health.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington Irving, in his work entitled
Astoria, relates a similar incident in the following
language: “The squaw of Pierre
Dorion (who, with her husband, was attached
to a party travelling over the Rocky
Mountains in winter-time, the ground being
covered with several feet of snow) was suddenly
taken in labor, and enriched her husband
with another child. As the fortitude
and good conduct of the woman had gained
for her the good will of the party, her situation
caused concern and perplexity. Pierre,
however, treated the matter as an occurrence
that could soon be arranged, and need cause
no delay. He remained by his wife in the
camp, with his other children and his horse,
and promised soon to rejoin the main body
on their march. In the course of the following
morning the Dorion family made its appearance.
Pierre came trudging in advance,
followed by his valued, though skeleton steed,
on which was mounted his squaw with the
new-born infant in her arms, and her boy of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>two years old wrapped in a blanket, and
slung on her side. The mother looked as
unconcerned as if nothing had happened to
her; so easy is nature in her operations in
the wilderness, when free from the enfeebling
refinements of luxury and the tampering appliances
of art.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When it has been ascertained that the labor
is natural, or that there are no impediments
or obstacles, there will be very little
more to do than superintend the process. It
will be necessary to give instructions to the
attendants to make suitable preparation, or
have everything required in readiness.</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman may be delivered upon a bed
or a cot, as is most convenient; if a bed be
used, all but the mattress should be turned
back toward the head, and it should be so
prepared that the moisture from the uterus
and other discharges may not add to the discomfort
of the woman. A dressed skin, oilcloth,
or folded blanket may be placed on that
part of the mattress on which the body of
the woman is to rest; a coarse blanket folded
within a sheet, ought to be laid immediately
beneath the patient, to absorb the
moisture, which must be removed after delivery;
the rest of the bed-clothes are to be
put on in the ordinary way. The woman,
when she is no longer able to remain up may
lie down, with her head elevated in any position
which is most desirable; and in nearly
every case that I have ever attended the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>back has been preferred, although most all
writers recommend that the woman be placed
upon her side: the latter practice is unnatural
and wrong, for obvious reasons; it
retards the labor pains, and prevents the
midwife from superintending the progress of
the labor; the pillow that is directed to be
placed between the knees, to keep them
widely separated, soon gets displaced by the
motion or change of the female; and the
legs, instead of being kept apart, again come
in contact, and thus the passage of the child
is obstructed: but when the female is placed
upon her back this difficulty is obviated, a
free passage is permitted, the pains are more
effectual, the spine is better supported, and
better access can be had to the parts during
labor and after the delivery of the child; in
short, there is a decided advantage in this
position in every respect.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dress of women in labor should be
light and simple, both to keep themselves from
being overheated, and to prevent anything
from being in the way of what assistance is
necessary. In addition to the means recommended,
I direct a sheet to be placed around
the waist of the woman, to prevent the blood,
excrements or waters from coming in contact
with the linen or clothes, and, as much
as possible, the bed; her linen may be tucked
or pushed up so far that there will be no necessity
of a removal after delivery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every thing being thus adjusted, very little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>more will be necessary but to wait patiently
the efforts and operations of nature.
There should be but few attendants in the
room, and these are not to whisper to each
other, or to express any fears or doubts.</p>

<p class='c007'>A humane midwife will use every ingenious
effort in her power to quiet the useless
fears, and support and comfort the patient.
A crowd of frightened, hysterical women,
assailing the ears of the woman with tales of
woe and sad disasters that have happened
should be admonished. Half a dozen midwives,
each making pretensions to great skill,
ambition, and competition for obstetric fame,
assembled around a feeble woman when labor
is of a lingering character, is always an
unfortunate circumstance, and it would be
much better if nearly every one were afar off.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the pains become very severe, quickly
succeeding each other, the midwife, or the
person who officiates, may sit by the side of
the woman, and, upon every severe pain,
may keep her hand upon the parts, even
though no manner of assistance can be afforded,
and occasionally, when the head of the
child presses hard, it may be gently touched
or pressed with the longest finger, in order
to ascertain the parts that prevent the progress
of labor, as well as to be able to give
from time to time suitable encouragement:
not only so; in the last stage of labor the
hand may be kept near the parts, to know
the moment when the head of the child presents,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>as some little assistance at this time is
called for; but not by supporting the perinæum,
as some advise, but,</p>

<p class='c007'><i>First.</i> To remove any obstruction which
often arises from the clothes.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Second.</i> To support the child in its passage,
and in the interval of pains; and to
keep the head from pitching downward, and
thus obstructing the labor.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Third.</i> To detach the umbilical cord or
navel-string from the neck when it encircles
it, as is often the case, and which endangers
the life of the child.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fourth.</i> To deliver the woman in case of
hemorrhage or great flooding; but at the
same time there must be no further interference
of art; little or nothing can be done
toward facilitating the delivery of the child,
except when a large bag or collection of water
presents and opposes, when it may be ruptured
with the longest finger, which often affords
much aid, although such is the ignorance
and credulity of some women, that they
suppose almost everything to be accomplished
by art. Physicians or midwives who watch
only the process of labor, and do little or
nothing, are pronounced inhuman and cruel,
and perhaps ignorant, because they are honest
in not interfering with the simple and
beautiful process of labor, or in other words,
for relying upon the great resources of nature:
but such is the fashion and credulity
of mankind, or rather womankind, that physicians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>are obliged to take the advantage of
such ignorance and credulity, and regulate
their proceedings accordingly. We have
often been obliged to stand for hours over a
woman, under pretence of aiding delivery,
when, in <i>reality</i>, we did nothing at all. The
labor would have progressed just as well
had we been out of the room; but this deception
we have been obliged to practise, in
order to satisfy ignorant, gossiping, or crying
attendants. When the woman is disposed to
make much noise, she should be directed to
hold her breath during the pains, and aid or
assist them by pressing downward as much
as possible. The feet may press against the
bed-post, and the woman take hold of a handkerchief
and pull when a pain occurs; or
she may grasp the hand of an assistant for
that purpose. Sometimes, from various causes,
labor is very much retarded, from rigidity
of the parts, the situation of the child, debility,
&#38;c.; when this occurs, and labor is tedious
and protracted, our reliance must still
be upon the powers of nature. We may,
however, aid her efforts, by warm fomentations
of <i>bitter herbs</i>, often applied to the lower
part of the belly, which will prove relaxing,
and will facilitate the labor; warm diluent
drinks may also be given, such as <i>tansy</i>, <i>pennyroyal</i>,
<i>&#38;c.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>If the labor still continues stationary, we
have nothing to fear, provided there is a
right presentation; but should the pains become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>feeble or lessened from flooding, debility,
or any cause, or should they prove unavailable,
after a reasonable length of time, a
drachm of <i>spurred rye</i> or <i>ergot</i> may be put
into a tea-cup, and a gill of boiling water
poured upon it, and, when cool, a tablespoonful
given every fifteen minutes. This will
increase the pains, and speedily accomplish a
delivery; but it should be very seldom, or
never, used, except when there is a right presentation,
and under the most urgent circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is prudent, by judicious precaution and
care, to remove obstructions, prevent accidents
by holding or supporting the child in a
proper position, and giving such aid as reason
and judgment will dictate. Receiving
the child, preventing its fall, securing the navel
cord, assisting in the removal and disposal
of the after-birth, are objects which are
to be accomplished, and all in the most calm
and simple manner; no hurry or excitement
is necessary, but, on the contrary, they embarrass.
Yet how common is it that females
in general, married and unmarried, are so uninformed
and ignorant, that, instead of attending
to those duties, if necessary, or in cases of
emergency, they are thrown into the greatest
consternation, and perhaps run out of the
room and let the child suffocate by the bed-clothes,
or by the navel cord twisted about
the neck, and die merely for the want of a
little common sense and knowledge, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>might be acquired in an hour. Is it not
highly disgraceful, if not criminal, that farmers
can, and do, attend to those duties toward
their stock, and yet remain entirely ignorant
of them toward their nearest relations?
Young women and men are taught music,
dancing, drawing, needle-work, and many ornamental
branches considered so essential to
a polite education; yet they are suffered to
remain entirely ignorant on a subject of so
much vital importance. Is there any hope
or prospect of enlightening this generation,
or must it be delayed till the next, and have
them look back with amazement at our ignorance?
We hope there is something yet redeeming
in a large proportion of the community;
that the people will yet awake to their
own interests.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the head is delivered, all that is necessary
to do is, to support it, and wait for
the pains to expel the child; except it seems
livid and in danger of injury, or when the
cord is twisted around the neck, when assistance
must be rendered, to accomplish the delivery.
The face of the child must now be
turned upward, and the cord freed from the
neck or body; the person who assists will
pass a narrow piece of tape around the cord
or navel-string, about an inch from the body,
and tie as tight as it can be drawn, otherwise
hemorrhage or bleeding will take place; and
another must be tied at a little distance from
it, above, and be separated between them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>with a pair of scissors. The child is then to
be given to the nurse, to be washed, dried,
and dressed. The woman must now be covered,
and directed to lie quiet.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The After-birth.</i>—The after-birth or placenta
must be detached or removed, if nature
does not accomplish it in a short time. Generally,
after about twenty or thirty minutes,
a pain is felt, which may be sufficient to expel
it; if it should not, and should there be
no pain, gentle manual attempts may be made
to remove it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The head and breast may be elevated, and
the cord taken hold of by the left hand: the
two first fingers may be carefully introduced
into the vagina, and the anterior or forepart
of the placenta or after-birth held in this situation
for some minutes, in order to excite a
contraction of the uterus. The woman may
now be directed to hold her breath and press
down, which forces it forward; and at the
same time a little extension may be made
upon the cord with the left hand, while extension
is made upon the after-birth with the
right; this will almost invariably extract it
in a few minutes. If from any cause it
should not, no farther attempts must be made
for the present, but left for a few hours,
when, if the natural contractions of the uterus
do not remove it, it must be done in the manner
recommended, with this difference, that
a little more force be used. In the interval,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>however, everything wet must be taken
away.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Subsequent Treatment.</i>—After the labour
has been thus completed, if the woman is
not too weak, assistants may raise her up,
and seat her upon the side of the bed or cot,
while another removes all the wet clothing
from the patient and her bed, and with a little
warm spirits washes off the blood, water,
&#38;c., that remain on her person. This is
particularly necessary, as the omission of it
may give rise to puerperal fever. We know
not that others have practised this method;
but we have found it conducive to the comfort
as well as the health of the patient.
Some practitioners will not suffer the woman
to be removed from the situation in which
she has been delivered under twelve or
twenty-four hours, for fear of hemorrhage
or flooding; but this is a great and dangerous
error. It is impossible to tell what mischief
may arise in consequence of suffering
her to remain drenched in water and blood
for this length of time.</p>

<p class='c007'>After these precautions have been observed,
and the bed properly prepared, on which
has been placed folded blankets, skin, or oilcloth,
covered with a warm sheet, she may
be laid down, and a diaper or suitable piece
of muslin laid to the parts to absorb the
lochial discharges. A bandage may be also
placed around the abdomen or belly, and
made moderately tight, but not so as to render
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>her uncomfortable. A large tub, previously
well dried, may be placed by the side
of the bed, and the woman directed to place
her feet in it, and, when she is lifted up, everything
that is around her wet to be passed
into it. It prevents the necessity of afterward
washing the floor and carpet, which
might prove injurious by causing a check to
perspiration.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Preternatural labor, or cross-births</i>, are
those in which some other part than the head
presents. We cannot in general assign any
reason for such occurrences, nor can the woman,
by any sensation of her own, be assured
that the presentation is unusual. Apprehensions
of this kind should not be indulged in.
If the feet or breech present, the delivery is
to be accomplished by properly accommodating
the position of the child to the capacity
of the pelvis, but no force should be
employed; and though there is always some
risk to the life of the infant, yet there is none
to the mother. If the arm, shoulder, or sides
of the child present, the delivery is not impossible,
but difficult, until the infant be turned
and the feet, brought down into the passage.
This is an operation which may be
done with comparative ease and safety, if the
wrong position of the infant be discovered
before the waters are discharged; but other
wise both mother and child are in considerable
danger, though there is often a spontaneous
evolution, and delivery is effected. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>womb closely contracting round the body of
the infant when the water is drained away,
and being soft and spongy in its texture, it is
liable to be torn if much force be employed,
and then either the child may escape into the
cavity of the belly, or, if it be extracted by
the feet, blood may be effused from the womb
into that cavity, and such injury be done as
to prove fatal. Women too frequently add
to the danger of the operation of turning, by
their restlessness and impatience; they should
remember how much is at stake, and exert
all their fortitude, so as not to embarrass
the practitioner.</p>

<p class='c007'>The labor having been thus accomplished,
it will be necessary to guard against any subsequent
symptoms which may occur or take
place.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>tedious</i> and very <i>difficult</i> labors, and
where common physicians use the lancet, the
hot bath will be found of extraordinary benefit
in facilitating labor, by its relaxing the
system without debility; altogether better
than bleeding. First apply spirits, water,
and salt to the head; then let the woman
continue in the bath about fifteen minutes.</p>

<hr class='c021'>

<p class='c007'><i>Still-born Infants.</i>—This occurs from difficult
labors, or the cord encircling the neck;
or a membrane may cover the head or
body. When anything of the kind occurs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>the membrane should be immediately
removed. If no signs of life appear,
the infant may be put into the warm
bath, and the mouth and body wiped dry.
A little cold water may be dashed into the
face, the lungs inflated by some person, and
a slight motion made upon the chest in imitation
of breathing. The navel-string may be
permitted to bleed a little.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>TREATMENT AFTER DELIVERY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><i>After-pains.</i>—Soon after delivery these
usually come on, and with some women
prove remarkably severe. The quicker the
labor has been, the slighter will they prove
in general. Women with their first child
are seldom much troubled with after-pains;
but as the uterus is thought to contract less
readily after each future labor, so they are
more liable to suffer from them in any succeeding
delivery than in the first.</p>

<p class='c007'>When after-pains prove so troublesome as
to deprive the patient of her rest, it will be
necessary to have recourse to <i>fomentations</i>
or <i>anodynes</i>; red pepper and spirits, simmered
together a few minutes, and flannels
dipped in it and applied to the belly, will
generally relieve them; if it fails, apply a
fomentation of <i>bitter herbs</i>, and give two teaspoonfuls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>of the tincture of <i>hops</i> in milk or
tea. If these fail, which I never knew, give
half a teaspoonful of <i>capsicum</i> in milk.
These remedies are to be assisted by keeping
up a sufficient pressure on the belly at the
same time by means of a broad bandage.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>NURSING.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A child must not be put to the breast, if
the mother’s health is very poor, or if she has
any venereal, scrofulous, consumptive taint,
or herpetic disease, St. Anthony’s fire, &#38;c.
We have conversed with females who
are subject to the last complaint, and who
have communicated it to their children,
which destroyed them all. The poison is
transmitted from the mother to the child. In
any of these cases, the infant must be reared
on the nursing bottle. It is best to use cream
instead of milk; the child thrives well upon
it, less quantity answers, and it does not
curdle, like milk, upon the stomach.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Atrophy from Suckling.</i>—Some women of
a delicate constitution cannot suckle long
without an evident appearance of declining
health; and, if persisted in, it might terminate
in a general wasting of the body and
loss of strength, or some morbid affection of
the lungs. When, therefore, a woman finds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>her health declining, and that she gets weaker
every day with loss of appetite and languor,
she ought immediately to leave off
suckling; she should use a generous diet,
with a moderate quantity of wine bitters
daily, and, if convenient, change the air, particularly
if an inhabitant of a large and populous
city or town. If the change is not
found sufficiently efficacious of itself, when
conjoined with a restorative diet, a course of
<i>tonics</i> should be given. Gentle exercise
on horseback or in a carriage will greatly
assist the effect of these remedies.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>INFLAMMATION OF THE BREASTS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This disease is easily known by the pain,
hardness, and swelling which accompany it.
In some cases the whole breast appears to
be affected; in others, only on one side;
and, in some, the effect is small and superficial.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the breast inflames, it is evident that
the retention of the milk must, for a time at
least, increase the pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first object then should be to have the
breasts drawn, either by the child or some
other means; but, should the milk not come
away readily, and the pain be increased
thereby, farther attempts must not be made;
otherwise both the disease and sufferings of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>the woman may be aggravated. A cooling
diet and an open state of the bowels are necessary
while the swelling continues. And
it is better for the patient to remain in bed,
as the weight of the breast, while in the
erect posture, often increases the inflammation.
The breast should be gently rubbed
with a small quantity of sweet oil or unsalted
butter, and poultices of crumb of bread and
lead water applied. If the pain and hardness
do not very soon go off by this application,
warm emollient poultices, as milk
and bread, with a little oil, or united with
the leaves of the thorn apple, must be had
recourse to. These poultices will not promote
suppuration unless the inflammation
has proceeded so far, that the process has
already begun, and in this case the sooner it
is produced the better.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the abscess do not point and break soon,
no good can be gained by delay: an opening
should therefore be made, so as to evacuate
the matter freely. This not only gives
immediate relief, but prevents a farther extension
of the mischief. The milk and bread
or flax-seed poultices must be continued for
a few days, in order to remove the hardness,
and then the part must be dressed, as in ordinary
cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>Indurations remaining after an abscess,
may be frequently remedied by the application
of a mercurial plaster, or cloths wet
with the camphorated spirit, or rubbing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>part, night and morning, with mercurial
ointment, united with a little camphor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes after the abscess heals, and the
breast seems to be cured, it swells a little,
especially towards night. This is from
weakness, and is cured by strengthening the
constitution.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many women suffer more from this complaint
than from all the various stages of
pregnancy, labor, and delivery combined,
and with whom broken breasts are an invariable
attendant of confinement; they overlook
all the other sufferings they have to undergo,
and fix their dread and apprehension
upon this. It is, therefore, all-important
<i>that inflammation of the breasts should not
be permitted to take place</i>, by proper precautionary
measures, <i>and this can, in all cases,
be accomplished</i>, by the mode of treatment
pointed out in this work, which, as yet, has
not been mentioned in any other, but of its
invariable success there is not a shadow of
doubt, as it has been tested under circumstances
the most unfavorable, in cases where
every confinement was attended with broken
breasts, till this mode of treatment was
had recourse to, and the patients, to their
great surprise and joy, for the first time entirely
escaped their uniform affliction. It is
hoped the medical faculty will avail themselves
of this invaluable mode of treatment,
that hereafter inflammation of the breasts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>may be unknown, since prevention is so easy
and practicable.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>To prevent Inflamed or Broken Breasts.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>This most desirable and important object
is accomplished by covering the entire
breasts with diachylon plaster (which can be
obtained of every druggist, the machine-spread
is preferable) rather tightly or closely
put on, merely making a round hole (about
the circumference of a dollar) for the nipple,
sufficiently large not to interfere with the
suckling of the infant, should it be put to the
breast; and if not, it is not only unnecessary
to draw the milk, but it would be advisable
to refrain from it, even if a little pain or distension
should supervene, as the milk is sure
to find an outlet in the nipple. The plaster
must be cut round and embrace and cover
the entire of each breast, and should be put
on within eight or ten hours after delivery,
and before the milk threatens. The effect is
to superinduce the flow of milk to the nipple,
from which it freely and profusely flows,
in no case requiring the application of stimulants
to induce its discharge, and, by keeping
the breasts in constant moisture, effectually
prevents hardness by coagulation of milk.
In ten days or thereabout the plasters can
be taken off without inconvenience.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not too much to say that broken or
inflamed breasts are impossible when this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>precautionary mode of treatment is adopted,
as it has, in every instance, where it has been
tested upon those who before were invariably
afflicted with broken breasts, been attended
with most triumphant success; and it has
thus been put to the test in more than fifty
instances to the writer’s personal knowledge.
In communicating this important fact, therefore,
he does so with the most thorough confidence
that he is conducing to the amelioration
of much suffering, and without assuming
that this may not be known to others, he
can only say that he has not met with any
mention of it in any works to which he has
had access. Should those, therefore, into
whose hands this work may fall have a wife,
or a relation, or a neighbor, who, heretofore,
have been afflicted with inflamed or broken
breasts, they would have it in their power to
ameliorate, nay, prevent much suffering,
which to the author of these lines will be a
source of heartfelt satisfaction.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>MANAGEMENT OF CHILDREN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is during infancy that the foundation of
a good constitution is generally laid, and it
is, therefore, important that parents be taught
the best method of managing their offspring,
in order to preserve their health. Great
ignorance is manifested on this subject; it is
owing to this that so many children sicken
and die; and, furthermore, it is in consequence
of this ignorance in our forefathers
that the present generation have become so
weak, sickly, and effeminate; and most of
these evils may be imputed to errors in diet,
regimen, <i>mineral</i> and <i>depletive</i> agents, &#38;c.
We have departed from the simplicity of nature,
and we must, of course, suffer the
penalty.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>1st. On Diet.</i>—If the mother or nurse
has enough of milk, the child will need little
or no food for the third or fourth month. It
will then be proper to give it a little of some
food that is easy of digestion once or twice a
day; this will ease the mother, will accustom
the child by degrees to take food, and will
render the weaning both less difficult and
less dangerous. All great and sudden transitions
are to be avoided in nursing; for
this purpose the food of children ought not
only to be simple, but to resemble as nearly
as possible the properties of milk: indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>milk itself should make a principal part of
their food, not only before they are weaned,
but for some time after.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next to milk we would recommend good
bread, which may be given to a child as soon
as it shows an inclination to chew; and it
may at all times be allowed as much as it
will eat. The very chewing of bread will
promote the cutting of the teeth and the discharge
of saliva, while, by mixing with the
nurse’s milk in the stomach, it will afford an
excellent nourishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many are in the habit of pouring down
various liquids and mixtures made of rich
substances, and so much sweetened that the
tender organs of digestion are impaired, and
acidity and bowel diseases follow; articles
of this nature should be avoided: no food,
except the milk of the mother, should be
given, unless absolutely necessary; nature
has designated this liquid exclusively for the
nourishment of the infant, and, indeed, we
may say, for children.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another precaution to be observed,
which is, “never to put an infant to a
wet-nurse if it can possibly be avoided;”
such persons are generally strangers, and
they often communicate the most loathsome
and fatal diseases; besides, their milk is often
rendered unwholesome by age or other
causes: this is a very unnatural practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The milk of the mother, then, should constitute
the only food of the infant, except in
cases of disease, when it becomes necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>to obtain a wet-nurse, or bring up the children
on the bottle, which can be done very
easily.</p>

<p class='c007'>We attended a lady who was almost
covered with a <i>herpetic complaint</i>, or the
<i>salt rheum</i>, and that, too, when her child was
born. She was treated and cured her of the
complaint. The infant was fed on milk, by
introducing a silver tube into a bottle containing
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>We never knew a child so quiet and free
from pain; as much so as any offspring of
the brute creation, which are free from it
merely by following nature or instinct, which
never errs. The milk should be of the best
quality, and, if possible, of the same cow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, it appears to us, that if females
imitated these animals, were to live on vegetable
instead of animal food, and drink nothing
but water, they would not only bring
forth as easy as the Indians or these animals,
but their offspring would be free from pain,
and perhaps be as exempt from sickness.
Would not this course produce a revolution
in our habits, health, and in the practice of
medicine? In the present diseased state of
society it might require a long time to bring
about a change in the system; but an immediate
benefit would follow by adopting
these physiological principles. Do not these
facts open a new field of investigation and
improvement?</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it not notorious that some infants are
crying a great portion of their time in consequence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>of pain? and is it natural, or can
there be any other cause, except the poison
communicated to it, through the medium of
the blood, before and after it is born; or the
disease may proceed from the impurity of
the mother’s milk, occasioned by errors in
diet? It is self-evident that it is so, from the
fact that animals are free from these symptoms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can there be any other cause why so many
children are in distress from birth, and generally
die young, or continue weak and sickly
all their lives? There must be a reformation
in the habits, taste, and education of modern
females. Many mothers are as ignorant,
when they have brought a child into the
world, of what is to be done for it as the
infant itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Says Combe: “The leading error in the
rearing of the young, I must again repeat, is
<i>over-feeding</i>, an error serious in itself, but
which may easily be avoided by the parent
yielding only to the indications of appetite,
and administering food slowly and in small
quantities at a time. By no other means can
the colics, and bowel-complaints, and irritability
of the nervous system, so common in
infancy, be effectually prevented, and strength
and healthy nutrition be secured. Nature never
meant the infant stomach to be converted into
a receptacle for laxatives, carminatives, antacids,
spicy stimulants and astringents; and
when these become necessary, we may rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>assured that there is something faulty in our
management, however perfect it may seem
to ourselves. The only exception is where
the child is defectively constituted, and then,
of course, it may fail to thrive under the
best measures which can be advised for its
relief.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Another cause of infantile indigestion,
and which is too much overlooked through
ignorance of its importance, is <i>vitiation of the
quality of the milk</i>, caused by imprudence,
neglect, or anxiety on the part of the mother.
The extent to which this cause operates in
inducing irritation and suffering in the child,
is not generally understood; and, accordingly,
it is not unusual for mothers to display as
much indifference to health, regimen, and
tranquillity of mind during nursing, as if the
milky secretion, and all other bodily functions,
were independent of every external
and corporeal influence. Healthy, nourishing,
and digestible milk can proceed only
from a healthy and well-constituted parent;
and it is against nature to expect that, if the
mother impairs her health and digestion by
improper diet, neglect of exercise, impure
air, or unruly passions, she can, nevertheless,
provide a wholesome and uncontaminated
fluid, as if she were exemplary in her observance
of all the laws of health.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is no new or uncertain doctrine, that
the quality of the mother’s milk is affected
by her own health and conduct, and that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>its turn it directly affects the health of the
nursling. Even medicines given to the parent
act upon the child through the medium
of the milk; and a sudden fit of anger, or
other violent mental emotion, has not unfrequently
been observed to change the quality
of the fluid so much as to produce purging
and gripes in the child. Care and anxiety,
in like manner, exert a most pernicious influence,
and not only diminish the quantity, but
vitiate the quality of the milk.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a common mistake to suppose that,
because a woman is nursing, she ought, therefore,
to live very fully, and to add an
allowance of wine, porter, or other fermented
liquor, to her usual diet. The only
result of this plan is to cause an unnatural
degree of fullness in the system, which places
the nurse on the brink of disease, and which
of itself frequently puts a stop to, instead of
increasing, the secretion of the milk. The
health and usefulness of country nurses are
often utterly ruined by their transplantation
into the families of rich and luxurious employers.
Accustomed at home to constant
bodily exertion, exposure to the air, and a
moderate supply of the plainest food, they
live in the enjoyment of the best health, and
constitute excellent nurses. But the moment
they are transplanted from their proper
sphere, their habits and mode of life undergo
an unfavourable change. Having no longer
any laborious duties to perform or any daily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>exposure to encounter, they become plethoric
and indolent; and as they are at the same
time too well fed, the digestive functions become
impaired, the system speedily participates
in the disorder, and the milk, which
was at first bland, nourishing, and plentiful,
now becomes heating and insufficient, and
sometimes even stops altogether.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Cocoa shells</i>, made precisely like coffee,
make a very pleasant and nutritious drink
for nursing females.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Weaning.</i>—“Diet for infants after weaning
may be pure milk, two parts, water, one
part; slightly sweetened. This,” says Combe,
“makes the nearest approach to the nature
of the mother’s milk, and, therefore, is more
suitable than any preparation of milk and
flour, or any other that can be given.” A
child, as a general rule, one year old, ought
to be gradually weaned, and the appearance
of the teeth shows the propriety of giving
food a little more substantial than milk.
Bread a day old, mixed with milk and sweetened,
may be given in connexion with nursing.
Gruel, arrowroot, plain bread, Indian
and rice puddings as they grow older, and
subsequently bread and butter, thickened
milk, hasty pudding or Indian, potatoes, and
vegetables. Not a particle of flesh should
ever be given. By the use of meat the system
becomes excited, and diseases of irritation
are apt to be produced, which impede
nutrition, and lead ultimately to the production
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>of scrofula and other organic changes
in the glands and bowels, and not unfrequently
also in the brain and lungs. In these instances
the child generally eats heartily, but,
nevertheless, continues thin, and is subject to
frequent flushing and irregularity of the bowels,
headache, and restlessness. His mind
partakes of the general irritability of the
system, and peevish impatience takes the
place of the placid good humour natural to
healthy childhood. In this state the ordinary
diseases of infancy—measles, scarlet fever,
and hooping-cough—are often attended with
an unusual and dangerous degree of constitutional
disturbance; and when inflammation
takes place it is borne with difficulty, and
the system does not easily rally; or the digestive
organs become irritated, and the various
secretions immediately connected with
digestion are diminished, especially the biliary
secretion. Constipation of the bowels
soon follows; congestion of the hepatic and
abdominal veins succeeds, and is followed by
the train of consequences which have already
been detailed. In reality the wonder
comes to be, not that so many children die,
but that so many survive their early mismanagement.
A morbid condition of the system
arises, extremely favourable to the production
of scrofulous, consumptive, dyspeptic,
and other diseases, under which, perhaps, the
infant sinks; and yet, strange to state, parents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>will stuff their children with flesh and grease
two or three times a day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Says Combe, “One of the most pernicious
habits in which children can be indulged is
that of almost incessant eating. Many mothers
encourage it from the facility with
which, for a time, the offer of ‘something
nice’ procures peace. Even from infancy
the child ought to be gradually accustomed
to eat only when hungry, and when food is
really required. After two years of age an
interval of four hours between meals, will
rarely be more than enough; and to give
biscuit, fruit, or bread, in the meantime, is
just subtracting from the digestive power of
the stomach. Like almost every organ of
the body, the stomach requires a period of
repose after the labour of digestion; and
accordingly, in the healthy state, the sensation
of appetite never returns till it has been
for some time empty. To give food sooner,
therefore, is analogous to making a weary
traveller walk on without the refreshment of
a halt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When we reflect that the object of digestion
is, to furnish materials for the growth
of the body, and to supply the waste which
the system is constantly undergoing, it must
appear self-evident that, if the digestive
powers be impaired by disease, by improper
quantity or quality of food, or by any other
cause, the result must necessarily be the
formation of an imperfect chyle, and, consequently,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>of imperfect blood. The elements of
the blood are derived from the chyle, and, if <i>it</i>
be vitiated, the blood also must suffer: if the
blood be diseased, so must necessarily be all
the organs which it supplies; and if the body
be thus debilitated, can any wonder be felt
that it should no longer be able to resist the
action of offending causes which full health
alone can withstand?”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Clothing.</i>—Infants and children are often
injured by improper clothing. It is customary
for some nurses to wrap them in such a
quantity as to injure their health; moderation
in this respect should be observed, due regard
being paid to that which is sufficient to render
them comfortable. Infants, when first
born, have clothing enough almost to smother
them.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Medicine.</i>—Another very reprehensible
custom is, to pour down some nauseous drug,
such as paregoric, Godfrey’s cordial, or some
other articles, every time the child begins to
cry or is fretful, by which it becomes habituated
to the use of opium, and makes it necessary
to increase the dose in order to
produce the same effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another injurious practice is to give frequently
worm lozenges (the basis of which
is calomel or mercury) upon any attack of
illness, under the impression that the disorder
is occasioned by worms. By this imprudent
course both the health and life of the child
are endangered. Therefore those who wish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>to bring up their children in a healthy condition
must avoid these evils, and be content
to follow the simple path of nature and common
sense.</p>

<p class='c007'>Few things tend more to the destruction
of children than drenching them with drugs.
Medicine may be <i>sometimes</i> necessary for
children; but that it injures them ten times
for once it does them good, I will venture to
assert. A nurse or mother, the moment her
child seems to ail anything, runs immediately
to the doctor or the apothecary, who throws
in his powders, pills and potions, till the poor
infant is poisoned; when the child might have
been restored to perfect health by a change
of diet, air, exercise, clothing, or some very
easy and simple means.</p>

<p class='c007'>Care must be taken to keep the bowels
regular, which may be effected in most cases
by the milk of the mother alone. Most of the
complaints in children arise from flatulence or
wind; to remove which give common catnip
or fennel seed tea, let them drink it freely,
and let the mother regulate her diet.</p>

<p class='c007'>When children complain of pain in the
stomach and bowels, it may be necessary
sometimes to give a moderate dose of vegetable
physic; <i>senna</i> and <i>manna</i> is very good;
after the operation of physic let the diet be
attended to. Green fruit must be avoided,
and whatever is hard of digestion. The
feet should be often bathed in warm water,
the bowels must be fomented with bitter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>herbs, and it is also necessary to give the
child sufficient exercise in the open air.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bathing</i> should never be neglected, as it
contributes much to health. Many complaints
of the skin and the system are caused
by the neglect of this practice. Filth collects
on the surface, obstructs perspiration,
which retains morbid humors, and which are
thrown upon some of the internal organs
and create irritation. Is it not owing to this
that infants fret and cry so much? Daily
bathe with tepid water; this is also good for
galling, chafing, excoriations, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Pure Air and Exercise.</i>—This is very necessary;
impure and confined air with the
want of exercise, causes disease; and hence
children in cities are more pale, feeble, and
sickly than those who live in the country
and breathe pure air and play in the dirt.
Confining children at home, in low, confined,
dirty houses, cellars, and in school-rooms, is
pernicious; also crowding too many in sleeping-rooms.
When children are confined in
small apartments, the air not only becomes
unwholesome, but the heat relaxes their solids,
renders them delicate, and disposes them to
colds and many other disorders. Nor is the
custom of wrapping them too close in cradles
less pernicious. One would think that nurses
were afraid lest children should suffer by
breathing free air, as many of them actually
cover the child’s face while asleep, and
others wrap a covering over the whole cradle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>by which means the child is forced to
breathe the same air over and over all the
time it sleeps. Children, therefore, must
have as much <i>exercise</i> and <i>air</i> as possible,
and should be employed in something useful
and interesting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again; “The premature exertion of intellect
to which the mind is stimulated at our
schools, by the constant emulation and vanity,
far from strengthening, tends to impair the
health and tone of the brain, and of all the
organs depending on it; and hence we rarely
perceive the genius of the school manifesting
in future years any of the superiority which
attracted attention in early life.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>BARRENNESS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Sterility proceeds from either a temporary
or permanent incapability of conceiving
or retaining the embryo, till it acquires a
form. The causes producing this incapability,
may consist in some malformation or
deficiency of the womb, or its appendages,
which cannot always be discovered during
life, or in merely a weakness in the action of
the womb. This last is by far the most frequent
cause, and it is occasioned by local
weakness of the womb, or general affections
of the whole system; and is marked usually
by an obstruction, deficiency, or redundancy
of the menstrual evacuation, or by the complaint
termed female weakness.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be considered as highly probable,
that the absence of the capacity to be impregnated,
will sometimes depend upon the
imperfect condition of either the uterus itself
or of the ovaries. If the former, it may consist
in some derangement of the secreting
surface of this organ; for, though there may
be a regular discharge of a colored fluid, and
this so nearly resembling the perfect secretion
as to deceive the senses, it may yet
want an essential condition or quality, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>thus entail barrenness—hence, all women are
not fruitful who may have a regular catamenial
discharge; though, as far as can be determined
by appearances, this discharge is
every way healthy, and at the same time, the
ovaries free from fault.</p>

<p class='c007'>If it depend upon an imperfection of the
ovaria, it may not, perhaps, admit of relief.
The diseases of the ovaria may consist, 1st,
in their imperfect development; 2dly, in
derangement of structure; 3dly, in a want
of a healthy organization of the ova themselves.
Now, either of these conditions of
the ovaria may be so complete as to altogether
destroy their influence upon the secreting
surface of the uterus; the catamenial
discharge may, therefore, continue, with all
due regularity, and yet the woman may be
barren; and, hence, this discharge cannot be
considered, rigidly, as a constant sign of
fertility.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet it may be safely admitted, as a general
rule, that women who menstruate regularly
without pain, or the expulsion of coagula, or
false membrane, are fecund; and that the
reverse of these conditions is almost sure to
be attended with sterility. It may also be
observed, that we cannot attach much consequence
to the quantity evacuated; for the
woman who may evacuate double the quantity
of another, is not for this reason more
certainly prolific. I have known a number
of instances of repeated impregnations, where,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>as far as could be ascertained, not more
than two ounces were habitually evacuated;
and this not occupying more than a day and
a half, or two days, for its elimination: while,
on the contrary, I have known women who
were barren, discharge three or four times
this quantity; and the fluid bear all the sensible
marks of a healthy secretion. From
this it would appear, that mere regularity in
returns, the elimination of a proper quantity
of fluid, and this fluid apparently of a healthy
character, do not always declare the woman
to be fecund. Yet, when the woman has
never menstruated, or when this discharge
has altogether ceased, agreeably to the ordinary
arrangement of nature, or from disease,
she either never becomes impregnated, or
ceases to become so, if she ever have been.</p>

<p class='c007'>We proceed on the principle of rectifying
the constitution, where it is injured or weak,
and of restoring the menstrual evacuation, to
its due and healthy state. The means for
effecting these purposes, must depend on the
situation of the individual.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Causes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>There are chiefly two states of the constitution
productive of those deviations in the
action of the womb, which cause barrenness.
The first is a state of fulness, and a
disposition to obesity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The person gradually becomes fat and inactive,
the menstrual evacuation continues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>regular for some time; but at last diminishes,
and becomes obstructed, or goes to the opposite
extreme, and becomes frequent or profuse.
The patient is either barren or subject to
false conceptions. This state is to be rectified
by spare or vegetable diet, total abstinence
from malt liquor, regular and constant
exercise, especially early in the mornings and
on horseback, the prudent use of laxatives,
and after some time the cold bath. These
means will, if persisted in prudently, effect
the desired changes; but if pushed to an
undue degree, and especially if repeated purgatives,
and much vinegar, or great abstinence
be resorted to, the health may be completely
ruined.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second state is that of relaxation; the
habit is spare, instead of corpulent; the mind
lively, and, perhaps, even irritable; the menstrual
evacuation either profuse, or it recurs
too frequently, and at times clots and shreds
are discharged.</p>

<p class='c007'>This requires a different treatment: the
diet, if not unusually nutritive, is at least not
to be sparing, the exercise must not be carried
the length of fatigue, the cold bath is
useful, and strengthening medicines are required.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such remedies as have been pointed out
for the removal of irregularities of the menstrual
evacuations, or of the fluor albus, must
be employed when necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are also certain diseases of the female
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>genital organs, which, when they exist,
are found to cause sterility. Polypus in utero
is very generally considered to belong to this
class; but although the opinion is generally
correct, it is not universally true, for it has
happened that conception took place notwithstanding
the presence of a very large tumor
in the uterus. Of this the late Dr. Beatty
(Trans. of the Association of Coll. of Phys.
in Ireland, vol. 4) has described a very remarkable
instance, which occurred in Dublin
in the year 1820. The patient was a lady
twenty-five years old, who, in consequence
of the indisposition of her husband, had left
his bed in May, 1819, to which she did not
return until August, 1820. In the previous
May she first perceived what she termed a
“lump in her womb,” attended with external
swelling and soreness on pressure at the
lower part of the abdomen. This swelling
was not permanent, but was observed to disappear
during the menstrual period. Finding
an increase in her unpleasant symptoms,
she applied to Dr. Beatty in September, and
on the 28th of that month he made an examination
per vaginam. The os uteri was found
dilated to the size of a dollar, and in its opening
was a large dense substance with a regular
smooth surface. On the 10th of November,
while out in her carriage, she had a
moderate discharge of blood from the vagina,
and upon examination the parts were found
as they were a month before. At two o’clock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>the following morning she miscarried, the
embryo was entire, the membranes not being
ruptured: the contained fœtus was about
three months old—a period corresponding
with the time at which the connubial intercourse
had been resumed, and at which she
had last menstruated; and just three months
after she first experienced uterine uneasiness.
The tumor was expelled in six days afterwards
by pains resembling labor, the uterus
was inverted by its descent, but on separation
of the slight attachment between it and the
tumor it was easily reduced. The weight of
the tumor was found to be nearly four pounds.
This lady was delivered of a healthy boy on
the 10th of February, 1822. This was an
instance of pregnancy during the existence
of a tumor of considerable magnitude in the
uterus; but we believe it to be an exception
to what usually takes place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inflammation, suppuration, calculous depositions,
cancer, cauliflower excrescence, corroding
ulcer, the irritable uterus of Dr.
Gooch, and any disease in which the texture
of the uterus is much engaged, or with which
the constitution sympathizes strongly, are so
many obstacles to impregnation, as are diseases
of the ovaria, in which the natural
structure of these organs is obliterated, and
both of them engaged. Leucorrhœa, when
profuse, is very often also attended by barrenness;
but this is by no means a constant
effect, as we have known instances in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>this disease existed to a great extent without
preventing impregnation.</p>

<p class='c007'>A question has arisen whether menstruation
is necessary in order that a woman shall be
prolific; and it is generally stated that women
who do not menstruate cannot conceive.
(<cite>Paris and Fonblanque</cite>, Med. Jur. vol. i., p.
214.) This is true when applied to those
who have never menstruated, but is not in
cases that have had even a single monthly
discharge. Foderé (Méd. Légale, vol. i., p.
397, ed. 2me) states that, in the first edition
of his work, he had maintained that females
who do not menstruate are sterile: but he
afterwards was obliged to change his opinion,
from having observed some patients under
his own care enjoying good health without
this evacuation, and bearing many children.
One of them was a woman thirty-five years
old, the mother of five children, the last of
which she was suckling. She was in good
robust health, and had never menstruated but
once at the age of seventeen years. It would
appear that a single occurrence of this periodical
evacuation is a sufficient indication of
generative power; and although irregularity
in subsequent years is frequently attended by
sterility, it is not to be taken as an absolute
cause of it. There is a form of dysmenorrhœa
described by Dr. Denman (Denman’s
Midwifery, 6th edit., p. 90), and Dr. Dewees
(Dewees’ Midwifery, p. 154) of Philadelphia,
which both these authors state to be productive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>of barrenness. The striking peculiarity
in this disease is the formation of an adventitious
membrane in the uterus, which is expelled
after severe and protracted suffering
at each menstrual period. This membrane
is sometimes thrown off in pieces, and at
others entire, at which time it bears the
strongest resemblance to the decidua, so much
so that, when it occurs in unmarried females,
it may and sometimes does give rise to most
painful suspicions. There is a preparation
in the museum of the College of Surgeons,
Dublin, of an entire membrane of this kind,
which might deceive the most experienced
eye. Morgagni relates a very remarkable
instance in which pregnancy occurred during
the existence of the habit just described, but
it is probable that there was a suspension of
the disease for a time in that case, when the
capability of conceiving might exist.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is well known that instances have happened
in which persons have lived for years
in unfruitful matrimony, and being after divorce
remarried, have both had children.
This is a fact which in the present state of
our knowledge we are not able satisfactorily
to explain, and we will not delay the reader
by offering any speculative opinion upon it.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Treatment.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The treatment of impotence and sterility
must be influenced by the causes from which
they spring, some of which are incurable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>whilst others may be removed by appropriate
remedies. Those cases which depend upon
congenital deficiency of the penis, testicles,
vagina, uterus, Fallopian tubes, or ovaria,
belong to the former; but we have seen that
some of those arising from malformation and
disease of these parts are susceptible of cure.
Such are phimosis, adhesion of the prepuce
to the glands with diminution of the orifice
of the urethra, priapism, partial paralysis,
strictures in the urethra, diseases of the neighbouring
parts, contracted vagina, occlusion
of the mouth of this canal by adhesion of
the labia, or by a dense hymen, prolapsus
and procidentia uteri, polypus in utero, leucorrhœa,
dysmenorrhœa: all these are more
or less capable of removal either by operation
or general treatment.</p>

<p class='c007'>By persisting carefully in a proper plan,
sterility may at length be frequently removed.
There are many instances of women bearing
children, after having been several years
barren.</p>

<p class='c007'>Various remedies have been recommended
for the cure of barrenness, among which
tincture of cantharides is the most prominent,
but its effects being evanescent, are invariably
succeeded by lassitude and debility, and
therefore can be attended with no good results.
The various preparations of sassafras
and sarsaparilla are useless and not in the
least calculated to reach the nature of the
case. The specific known as the most successful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>in curing sterility or barrenness—and
it has certainly performed wonderful
cures—is the celebrated Morand’s preparation,
called “Morand’s Elixir,” which appears
to be specially adapted to give tone and
healthiness to the generative functions, for
the discovery of which, he received a handsome
donation from the French government,
as also frequently rewarded by the liberality
of private individuals, who have realized
their fond wishes by his discovery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Its effects, it is said, are so wonderful upon
the general health, and particularly upon the
generative functions, that a medical writer
of some note says that he has recommended
its use in several instances, and, with one
single exception (a case of malformation),
with invariable success. He says:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was acquainted with a very worthy
married couple whose life was, if not embittered,
at least unhappy, because of their having
no offspring. They were of respectable
and influential standing, possessed of property,
surrounded by friends and relatives,
were then married nearly ten years, and desirous
only of having children to make them
happy. Physicians were consulted without
success, because physicians mostly look upon
sterility as incurable.</p>

<p class='c007'>“About this time I visited a patient who
had been married about seven years without
having children, who was affected with fluor
albus (whites), and was using ‘Morand’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>Elixir,’ by my recommendation, to eradicate
this weakening complaint from the system.
This lady having been married seven years,
as I before observed, without offspring, had
nearly resigned herself to a conviction that
she was destined to have none. In recommending
‘Morand’s Elixir,’ I had the fullest
confidence that it would accomplish a thorough
cure of her complaint, because I had
often used it in my practice, and with invariable
success, but I had neither hope nor
expectation of its ability to remove what I
then considered confirmed sterility, or barrenness,
as I then gave no credence to the
various marvellous properties it was alleged
to possess, classing it merely among the impositions
of the day. The lady continued its
use, and I found her health evidently and perceptibly
improve. The fluor albus entirely disappeared
and her health was restored. Under
pretence that she derived great benefit from
it she still continued its use, however, and to
my utter surprise, as well as the great joy of
her husband, four months after she commenced
its use, she became pregnant, and in
due time was delivered of a fine, fat, healthy
daughter, and had two more children in close
succession after.<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c012'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>“The lady being of the most pure and irreproachable
character, it may well be supposed
that it gave me the greatest confidence
in recommending this truly wonderful
‘Elixir,’ in like cases. When, therefore, I
was consulted by the husband of the lady
first mentioned, I did not hesitate to recommend
‘Morand’s Elixir,’ and informing him
of its effect in the case described. My advice
was followed. In due course of time this
worthy couple had their fondest wishes realized.
Since which time they also have had
several children. Their gratitude to me for
recommending its use, was unbounded. My
confidence in the virtues of ‘Morand’s Elixir,’
was confirmed, and I have heard of its success
in other instances. Indeed, I am convinced,
that if the case is curable, ‘Morand’s
Elixir’ is infallible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It has attained a pre-eminent celebrity in
France, Germany, on the continent of Europe
generally, as well as in England, for its unexampled
success in removing general debility,
weakness, physical imbecility and <i>supposed</i>
barrenness (for judging from the astonishing
results of ‘Morand’s Elixir,’ it is denied that
it really exists). The truly wonderful effect
of the “Morand’s Elixir,” has now established
the fact that most, if not all, <i>supposed natural</i>
incurable defects, are <i>only artificial</i> ones,
within the powers of the skill and scientific
combination of the virtues and essences of
the most nourishing, strengthening and invigorating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>fruits and plants of Italy to remove.
Its action is not sudden and ephemeral, leaving
the system but the more debilitated by
reason of the previous unnatural excitement,
but is gentle and gradual, by degrees displacing
the latent causes affecting the body,
strengthening and invigorating the generative
functions, cheering the mind, enlivening
the spirits, engendering a free, full and healthy
circulation, and thus arousing the sexual
feelings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Great and surprising as are the results of
the skilful and scientific combination in the
composition of “Morand’s Elixir,” it is not idly
pretended that without any reference to the
circumstances of each individual case of supposed
barrenness, it will, unaided and unassisted,
in a few weeks, remove deep seated
and obstinate cases of unfruitfulness—causes
which had been growing, strengthening and
fastening for years. Far from it. The absurdity
of such pretence is manifest on the
face of it. Assistants, in many instances,
must be resorted to for successful treatment,
in respect to diet, clothing, occupation, &#38;c.
Instant and immediate relief is neither to be
expected nor practicable; and even if practicable
would lead to the most injurious results,
aggravating instead of relieving. A
remedy, therefore, to be permanent, must be
gradual to an almost imperceptible degree,
slowly but surely removing the stagnant humors
and impure secretions, by the searching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>and penetrating virtues of the “Elixir,” systematically
purging the system of those dormant
and inactive particles, which frustrate
the action of the generative functions, and
thus dislodging the cause of unfruitfulness.
It may take some time ere this is accomplished;
but, by a proper perseverance in the
course marked out, success, sooner or later, is
inevitable. Thousands who had imagined
themselves irretrievably doomed to descend
to the grave unpitied and unmourned by interesting
and affectionate children have, by
the use of “Morand’s Elixir,” been blessed
with offspring to love and adore in infancy
and youth, and to look to for comfort and
solace in old age.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all cases of incontinence of urine, fluor
albus, gleet, painful and difficult menstruation,
incipient stages of consumption, languor,
debility, night sweats and wakefulness, it is
surprisingly efficient and certain. Its chief
and great celebrity, however, in eradicating
every symptom of that state of the functions
superinducing barrenness or sterility, is too
well established to require comment. Indeed,
such has been its success, as to make it doubtful
that what is usually termed barrenness in
fact exists, since by the use of this wonderful
remedy, properly persevered in, a cure has
in all cases been effected, and what had been
supposed incurable natural defects proved to
be only some deranged state of the functions.</p>

<p class='c007'>As there are many who pine and grieve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>for children—who feel desolate and lonely
without the enlivening and cheering influence
of children around the domestic hearth, the
author does not deem it inappropriate or out
of place to present this celebrated specific
for the consideration of those to whom it
might prove a great blessing. He has taken

  <h2 class='c005'>CONCLUDING REMARKS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In conclusion, the author of this work trusts
that it may prove an invaluable blessing as
well to the unmarried as married, to those in
affluence as well as to those in penury. To
the matured woman in the full enjoyment of
the elasticity and vigor of health, its pages
direct how to retain that precious boon. To
the weak, sickly, debilitated one, it lays bare
the causes of her malady, and points out the
remedy. To the young female about blooming
into maturity—that critical juncture, involving
her future health and welfare, its
pages reveal the shoals and quicksands, surrounding
her on all sides, and the necessary
steps to avoid them. To the female already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>suffering from various complaints, arising
either from retention or stoppage of the
menses, their irregularity, or too profuse
flow, the means of a thorough and effectual
cure are pointed out. To the woman suffering
in health from a too rapid increase of
family, the perusal of these pages shows that
pregnancy can and should, under some circumstances,
be prevented. To those unblessed
with children, from a supposed existence
of barrenness, the indubitable facts
herein contained, demonstrate that by following
certain suggestions the result may
not be <i>fruitless</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In short, in all the relations of life in which
a female can be placed, whether as a daughter,
a wife, or a mother—whether in the enjoyment
of good, or suffering under ill health—whether
physically formed capable of
enduring the various trials imposed upon
her by nature, or whether mal-formed or
physically incapable to endure them, this
little book is one that no female having a
regard for her own welfare, or that of her
husband or children, will be without.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. The most successful specific, and one almost invariably
certain in removing a stoppage, irregularity, or suppression
of the menses (monthly turn), is a compound invented
by M. M. Desomeaux, of Lisbon, Portugal, called
the Portuguese Female Pills. It would appear that they
are infallible, and would, undoubtedly, even produce
miscarriage, if exhibited during pregnancy. And what
is equally important, they are always mild, healthy, and
safe in their effects.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the female hospitals in Vienna and Paris, their exhibition
has entirely superseded the use of the ordinary
remedies; because, where a cure is attainable by medicinal
remedies, they are certain of success. Their astonishing
efficacy would be almost incredible, if not
vouched for by indubitable testimony, in numerous instances
producing returns of the monthly periods after
all hope had been abandoned. A remarkable case is
related by Dr. A. M. Mauriceau, during his residence in
Paris.</p>

<p class='c007'>“While residing in Paris, I had frequent opportunities
of witnessing the astonishing efficacy of the Portuguese
Female Pills in obstinate cases of the suppression
of the menses. Their effect, in one instance in particular,
seemed almost miraculous. A young lady, about
twenty years of age, of wealthy and respectable parentage,
had not menstruated for nearly two years before her
application to me. On inquiry, I ascertained that her
health was not seriously affected (except at intervals of
about four weeks, occasioned, doubtless, by the efforts
of nature to perform her functions), until within the
preceding four months, when her symptoms began to
assume an alarming appearance. Her medical attendants
here prescribed the usual remedies without success.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must confess, I thought her case desperate, and
had but little hope that Desomeaux’s celebrated Portuguese
Pills, which I determined to put to the test, would
here avail, as I had never known them to be administered
under circumstances quite so apparently hopeless
for a cure. But I resolved upon a trial. Accordingly
I recommended their use, watching their effects upon
the patient. At first their virtue, so to speak, seemed
to be only negative—that is, the young woman got no
worse. This, however, under the circumstances, I considered
a point gained. In the course of three weeks
favorable indications began to present themselves. The
appetite was better; the deathly-sallow complexion
giving place to a healthy hue; the eyes, also, becoming
clearer, but still no menstrual discharge. The improvement,
however, meanwhile, became more and more
apparent, till, at the end of the ninth week after commencing
their use, a slight, somewhat reddish discharge
took place. Here was a beginning; the patient still
improving, taking moderate exercise, with light but
nourishing diet. Their exhibition was then dispensed
with until within five or six days just previous to the
expected return of the menses, when they were again
used, and their use continued during the seven days; on
the eighth the menses again appeared—on this occasion
somewhat freer, but still not in sufficient quantity.
Their exhibition ceased with the cessation of the menses,
which lasted irregularly about four days. This treatment
continued to the end of the fourth month, when
the monthly returns were perfectly established. At
each successive appearance they assumed a healthier
color, freer in quantity, and less obstructed by coagula.
The patient entirely recovered, and became possessed
of sound health.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He then relates another instance still more surprising.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A woman applied to be treated for suppression. It
appeared that she had been subject to irregularity, or
stoppage of the monthly turns, and as she appeared to be
free from the usual symptoms attending pregnancy, it
was not supposed that the stoppage arose from that
cause. She commenced using Desomeaux’s Pills. After
using them about five days—from certain indications attending
miscarriage—apprehensions began to be entertained
that the suppression might have arisen from pregnancy,
which, upon examination, proved to be the case—too
late, however, to prevent the miscarriage. In a
short time the expulsion took place, and on about the
third day after she entirely recovered, with but little
comparative inconvenience to her general health.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He further states that their efficacy and certainty are
such, that they are sometimes administered in cases of
malformation of pelvis, when the female is incompetent
to give birth at maturity. But when such is the case,
M M Desomeaux’s “Preventive to Conception,” treated
of in another part of this work, under the head of “Conception,
when it should be Prevented,” is the proper
remedy.</p>

<p class='c007'>These proofs of their wonderful powers have induced
Dr. Mauriceau, since his return from France, to take
the sole agency for the United States. They are to be
obtained of him only, as they can be transmitted by mail
to any part of the Union. For whole boxes the price is
five dollars; half-boxes, three dollars. Address to “Box

diseases of women, especially those arising from suppression
of the menses, in the successful treatment of which
M. M. Desomeaux’s Pills have been of such eminent service
to him. Office 129 Liberty street.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. I have had, very lately, a lady under my care, who
menstruates with the most perfect regularity; though she
had labored under a prolapsus of the uterus to a great
extent for several years. She is now in her sixty-fifth

pessary, which has much improved her general health.—<cite>Dewees.</cite></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. Indeed, it would seem that this period of female life
is freer from diseases causing death, than almost any
other. By some late observations made on the bills of
mortality in France, by M. Boiniston of Chateauneuf, it
appears that fewer women die between the ages of forty
and fifty, than men, or indeed at any other period of their
lives, after puberty. And, further, that if this change is
effected without much disturbance, that they live not
only longer than men, but are free from morbid inconveniences.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. A remarkable case is mentioned by Morgagni:—“I
was acquainted,” he says, “with a maiden of a noble family,
who married before menstruation took place,
though the menses had been expected for some years;
nevertheless she became exceedingly fruitful. We
were the less surprised at this circumstance because the
same thing had happened to her mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank attended a patient who gave birth to three children
without ever having been unwell. Capuron, also
refers to several cases of this description, and Foderé assures
us of the fact. A case of the kind occurred too in
the practice of Mr. Montgomery. Low likewise mentions
a similar instance. Sir E. Moore relates the case
of a young woman who married before she was seventeen,
and never having menstruated, became pregnant, and
four months after delivery was pregnant a second time;
the same thing occurred again, and after the third pregnancy
she menstruated for the first time, continued to do
so for several periods, and became pregnant again.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should be remembered, however, that some women
are very irregular in the return of their menstrual periods—having
them prolonged much beyond the usual interval.
Mr. Montgomery once attended an unmarried
woman of forty, who assured him that returns of the
menses had frequently been delayed more than six
months without causing ill health. Instances of menstrual
suppression for shorter periods are frequent. Zacchias
mentions that he attended a patient who used to menstruate
regularly, but who never conceived until the discharge
had been suppressed for three or four months
previously. Mauriceau relates a somewhat similar case,
and remarks that cases of this character give rise to the
supposition of protracted pregnancy.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. Mr. Robertson of Manchester inquired minutely into
the result of one hundred and sixty cases, in which he
found that eighty-one women had become pregnant once
or oftener during suckling.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. Dr. Heberden was acquainted with a lady who never
ceased to have regular returns of the menses during four
pregnancies, quite to the time of her delivery.—<cite>Heberden

<p class='c007'>This opinion is confirmed by Gardien, Dewees, Hamilton,
Desormeaux, Puzos, Francis, &#38;c.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. “A woman came to me one morning,” says Dr. Gooch,
“with a note from a medical man, containing the following
statement: The patient’s age was forty-two; she had
been married twenty-two years without ever being pregnant.
About seven months ago she had ceased to menstruate;
a few months afterwards the abdomen began to
enlarge, and was now nearly equal to that of full pregnancy.
For several months the practitioner had been
using various means for reducing the tumour, but in vain.
I examined the case, pronounced her pregnant, and seven
weeks afterward she brought forth a child at the full
time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Montgomery says: “A lady in her forty-third
year, who was married to her present husband twenty
years ago, remained without any promise of offspring
until within the last few months; but having missed her
menstruation in September last, and finding her size increasing,
I was requested to see her in January, when
she exhibited evident symptoms of pregnancy. She was
subsequently delivered of a healthy boy, after a natural
labor of about four hours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mosse, one of the medical officers of the Dublin Lying-in-Hospital
in 1775, states, that eighty-four of the women
delivered in the Institution under his superintendence
were between the ages of forty-one and fifty-four;
four of these were in the fifty-first year, and one in her
fifty-fourth.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. It may, however, be considered almost a settled fact,
that when a female has menstruated regularly up to the
time of cohabitation, and immediately after ceases to
menstruate at the time of their usual return, especially
if attended with morning sickness—that pregnancy has
taken place.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the presence of milk in the female breast shall
take place independent of pregnancy, from the above
and other recorded facts, there can be no doubt; but the
following beautiful exemplification of its formation in
that of the <i>male</i>, places the question in a still stronger
light. This interesting fact is cited from Captain Franklin’s
narrative of his journey to the shores of the Polar
Sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A young Chipewyan had separated from the rest of
his band, for the purpose of entrapping beaver, when
his wife, who was his sole companion, and in her first
pregnancy, was seized with her pains of labor. She died
on the third day, after giving birth to a boy. The husband
was inconsolable, and vowed in his anguish, never
to take another woman to wife; but his grief was soon
in some degree absorbed in anxiety for the fate of his
infant son. To preserve its life he descended to the
office of a nurse, so degrading in the eyes of a Chipewyan,
as partaking of the duties of a woman. He swaddled it
in soft moss, fed it with broth made from the flesh of the
deer; and to still its cries, applied it to his breast, praying
earnestly to the Great Master of Life to assist his
endeavors. The force of the powerful passion by which
he was actuated produced the same effect in his case as
it has done in some others which are recorded: a flow
of milk actually took place from his breast. He succeeded
in rearing his child, taught him to be a hunter,
and when he attained the age of manhood, chose him a
wife from the tribe. The old man kept his vow in never
taking a wife for himself, but he delighted in tending
his son’s children; and when his daughter-in-law used
to interfere, saying, that it was not the occupation of a
man, he was wont to reply, that he had promised the
Great Master of Life, if his child was spared, never to
be proud like other Indians. Our informant, Mr. Wenkel
(one of the Association) added, that he had often
seen this Indian in his old age, and that his left breast,
even then, retained the unusual size it had acquired in
his occupation of nurse.” P. 157.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f27'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r27'>27</a>. There are one or two complaints to which the pregnant
female is subject, upon which a few remarks seem
advisable. Speaking of headache, Mr. Fox remarks:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Headache, independent of accidents, may be a sympathetic
affection arising from disorders of the digestive,
or other organs. It may be the consequence of a feeble,
or disturbed state of the nervous system: or it may be
the effect of the vessels of the head being distended with
too much blood; or even of a deficiency of blood in the
head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where headache arises from a disordered condition
of the digestive organs there will generally be an inactive,
or irritable, state of the stomach or bowels,
which will frequently be accompanied by giddiness, imperfect
vision, or by specks floating a short distance
from the eyes, by loss of appetite, sickness, acidity of
the contents of the stomach, and by flatulence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the stomach be loaded with undigested, or irritating
food, it is to be relieved by a gentle emetic. Having
drunk a pint of warm chamomile tea, or common tea
from one ounce to one ounce and a half of ipecacuanha
wine should be taken, after which vomiting will ensue
almost immediately, and without any straining, or painful
effort. If ipecacuanha wine is not at hand, two or
three teaspoonfuls of powdered mustard, mixed in a
little water, may be used in its stead.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In almost every case, it will be found necessary to
administer mild aperients every four or five hours, till
the bowels are emptied. The aperients may be, rhubarb
and Castile soap, of each one drachm, oil of cloves
six drops, mixed with a simple syrup, and divided into
thirty pills, of which from three to six are to be taken
every four or five hours, till the bowels act. Where no
disposition to pills exists, from one to two table spoonfuls
of compound decoction of aloes may be taken every
four or five hours, till the bowels are relieved freely.
Where much acidity in the stomach is present, from
fifteen to twenty grains of magnesia, combined with six
grains of powdered rhubarb, and the same quantity of
ginger, may be substituted for the above aperients, and
repeated in a similar manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the pain in the head continues to be severe, after
an emetic has operated, or before the aperients begin to
act, it will be often greatly mitigated by taking a moderate
dose of some opiate; this, however, should not be
employed where attacks are frequent, as a habit of
taking opiates is productive of much injury.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are persons who do not experience relief
from opiates, but on the contrary, have the pain aggravated
by their use. Strong green tea, or hop tea, will
occasionally give relief in mild attacks, or where decided
opiates are not productive of benefit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where a feeble, or disturbed state of the nervous
system gives rise to headache, aperients are to be taken
as recommended above; and stimulants are to be employed,
as camphor, ammonia, compound tincture of
valerian, æther, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Four grains of carbonate of ammonia, or fifteen or
twenty drops of spirit of hartshorn, are to be mixed in
a wineglassful of camphor julep.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One or two teaspoonfuls of compound tincture of
valerian are to be added to a wineglassful of water, or
camphor julep.</p>

<p class='c007'>“From twenty to forty drops of æther are to be mixed
in a wineglassful of water or camphor julep.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Any of the foregoing forms may be taken several
times during every twenty-four hours, if necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the head is hot, linen wet with vinegar and water,
or eau de Cologne and water, is to be repeatedly applied
to the temples and forehead; or those parts may be
occasionally moistened with æther, the evaporation of
which will cause the head to become cool.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where reducing the temperature of the head does
not diminish the pain, it will be well to try the effect
of heat, which may be accomplished in the following
manner: pour a little æther into the palm of the hand,
and apply it to the forehead, or temples. The heat will
be kept up so long as the hand is pressed to the part,
and any of the æther remains.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In severe cases of headache, the patient is to lie
perfectly quiet, with the head moderately raised by pillows,
and the room is to be darkened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the feet are cold, they should be put into warm
water; and if they have a disposition to become chilled
again soon, they are to be kept warm by heated flannels,
or bottles filled with hot water.</p>

<p class='c007'>“During an attack of headache, arising from disordered
digestive organs, it is essential that the food be
very simple, and small in quantity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In headache, from nervous disorders, requiring stimulants,
the food may be of a nutritious quality; the
quantity, however, should be moderate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The foregoing remarks apply to sudden, or severe
attacks of headache. When slighter affections of the
same nature often occur, strict attention to diet, exercise,
and the use of aperients, as recommended in a previous
chapter, will greatly tend to mitigate the suffering,
and to keep off the complaint altogether.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where headache comes on in consequence of fulness
of the blood-vessels of the head, it will be indicated by
a sense of weight within the skull, drowsiness, giddiness,
particularly on stooping, sickness, ringing or other
sounds in the ears, and bright flashes, or sparks in the
eyes. In these cases, it will generally be necessary to
bleed the temples with eight or ten leeches; and if their
application to those parts is known to produce swelling
of the eyes and face, the leeches may be placed behind
the ears. The head is then to be kept cool by applying
cold vinegar and water to it; and purgatives are to be
administered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The diet is to be very simple, animal food is to be
avoided, and no stimulants are to be taken.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Headache may arise from whatever induces debility.
It is generally experienced where great loss of blood
has taken place, and it may seem singular that the symptoms
and sensations of this kind of headache, appear to
be the consequence of the vessels of the head having too
much blood in them. For instance, there are usually
noises resembling the violent beating of a hammer, the
rushing of water, the blowing of wind, ringing, &#38;c. It
is therefore necessary to notice the condition of the system,
to be enabled to decide whether the pain arises
from a deficiency, or from an over supply of blood to the
head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A correct decision should be formed upon this point,
by ascertaining whether there is a disposition to fulness
of the system, or a state of emptiness of the vessels from
great loss of blood, with general debility.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the latter case, quietness is most essential: wine
and other stimulants, will be necessary; together with
a light nutritious diet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Opiates also will generally be found requisite, such
as have been previously enumerated in this chapter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In all cases of headache, mental tranquillity is of
much importance; and the patient should not persevere
in the pursuit of any occupation which materially increases
the pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In this disorder, as well as in many others, accompanied
by much irritability, the sleep is often seriously
interrupted by slight noises; in most cases, this may be
prevented by stopping the ears with small plugs, three
quarters of an inch in length, and about one quarter of
an inch in diameter. If the plugs be made of white
wax, they will generally answer the best, as they admit
of being accurately moulded to the form of the openings
of the ears. Plugs made of turned wood will sometimes
be sufficient.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If such plans as the foregoing do not soon give relief,
medical advice should be had, especially where it is
supposed that there is too much blood in the vessels of
the head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tenderness and irritability of the external parts
sometimes come on to an almost intolerable extent, in
consequence of inflammatory action. They are most
effectually relieved by bathing the parts occasionally
with cold or hot water, or decoction of poppy-heads, or
of laurel leaves, and by using a soothing lotion. The
soothing lotion may be made of two drachms of acetate
of lead, commonly called sugar of lead, and an ounce of
laudanum, in seven ounces of water. It may be applied
three or four times during every twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In these troublesome affections the bowels must be
kept rather more active than usual by gentle aperients.
The aperients to be, from two to four drachms of Epsom
salts. From one to two teaspoonfuls of electuary of
senna. From one to two spoonfuls of castor oil. Or
from fifteen to thirty grains of magnesia. Any of which
may be taken every second night, or every night, as circumstances
may require. The diet should be mild, and
there must be a total abstinence from spirit, wine, and
malt liquor. If these means fail to give the desired
relief, it will be advisable to bleed the parts occasionally
with six or eight leeches, and to apply poultices of the
same kind, and in the same manner, as recommended in
another chapter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A discharge frequently appears from the passage,
which is either white, or slightly tinged with green, or
blood; in such cases, the parts are to be washed, or the
passage injected with a syringe, twice daily, with tepid
milk and water, or a weak solution of alum in water.
For the wash or injection, twelve grains of alum may
be dissolved in six ounces of water, and about two tablespoonfuls
injected at each time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Means should be used to secure the regular action
of the bowels, by employing mild aperients and injections,
as previously recommended.</p>

<p class='c007'>“More vigorous measures than the above might be
productive of much mischief.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r28'>28</a>. One of the English kings, Edward III., in the year
1344, picked up from the floor of a ball-room, an embroidered
garter, belonging to a lady of rank. In returning
it to her, he checked the rising smile of his courtiers
with the words, “Honi soit qui mal y pense!” or, paraphrased
in English, “Shame on him who invidiously
interprets it!” The sentiment was so greatly approved,
that it has become the motto of the English national
arms. It is one which might be not inaptly nor unfrequently
applied in rebuking the mawkish, skin-deep, and
intolerant morality of this hypocritical and profligate age.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r29'>29</a>. It may perhaps be argued, that all married persons
have this power already, seeing that they are no more
obliged to become parents than the unmarried; they may
live as the brethren and sisters among the Shakers do.
But this Shaker remedy is, in the first place, utterly
impracticable, as a general rule; and, secondly, it would
chill and embitter domestic life, even if it were practicable.</p>

possible temptation, and therefore no existence, were not
men unnaturally and mischievously situated. It first appeared,
probably in monasteries; and has been perpetuated
by the more or less anti-social and demoralizing
relation in which the sexes stand to each other, in almost
all countries. In estimating the consequences of the
present false situation of society, we must set down to
the black account the wretched consequences (terminating
not unfrequently in incurable insanity) of this vice,
the preposterous offspring of modern civilization. Physicians
say that onanism at present prevails, to a lamentable
extent, both in this country and in England. If the
recommendations contained in these pages were generally
followed, it would probably totally disappear
in a single generation.</p>

unreasoning—sometimes even generous, imprudence of
youthful passion, and the calculating selfishness of the
matured and heartless libertine. It is a melancholy
truth, that pseudo-civilization produces thousands of seducers
by profession, who, while daily calling the heavens
to witness their eternal affections, have no affection
for anything on earth but their own precious and profligate
selves. It is to characters so utterly worthless as
these that my observations apply.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f35'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r35'>35</a>. I should like to hear these gentlemen explain, according
to what principle they imagine the chastity of
their <i>wives</i> to grow out of a fear of offspring; so that, if
released from such fear, prostitution would follow. I
can readily comprehend that the unmarried may be
supposed carefully to avoid that situation to which no
legal cause can be assigned; but a wife must be especially
dull, if she cannot assign, in all cases, a legal cause; and
a husband must be especially sagacious, if he can tell
whether the true cause be assigned or not. This safeguard
to married chastity, therefore, to which the gentlemen
of the Committee alluded to seem to look with so
implicit a confidence, is a mere broken reed; and has
been so ever since the days of Bethsheba.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet <i>conjugal</i> chastity is that which is especially valued.
The inconstancy of a wife commonly cuts much
deeper than the dishonour of a sister. In that case, then,
which the world usually considers of the highest importance,
the fear of offspring <i>imposes no check whatever</i>.
It cannot make one iota of difference whether a married
woman be knowing in physiology or not; except perhaps,
indeed, to the husband’s advantage; in cases where the
wife’s conscience induces her at least to guard against the
possibility of burthening her legal lord with the care
and support of children that are not his. Constancy,
where it actually exists, is the offspring of something
more efficacious than ignorance. And if in the wife’s
case, men must and do trust to something else, why not
in all other cases, where restraint may be considered
desirable? Shall men trust in the greater, and fear to
trust in the less? Whatever any one may choose to
assert regarding his relatives’ secret inclinations to
profligacy, these arguments may convince him that if he
has any safeguard at present, a perusal of these pages
will not destroy it.</p>

<p class='c007'>’Tis strange that men, by way of suborning an argument,
should be willing thus to vilify their relatives’
character and motives, without first carefully examining
whether anything was gained to their cause, after all, by
the vilification.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f36'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r36'>36</a>. Instances innumerable might be adduced. Not one
young person, for example, in twenty, is ever told, that
sexual intercourse during the period of a woman’s
courses is not unfrequently productive to the woman of a
species of fluor albus, and sometimes (as a consequent) to
the man of symptoms very similar to those of urethritis or
gonorrhœa, but more easily removed. Yet what fact
more important to be communicated? And how ridiculous
the mischievously prudish refinement that conceals
from human beings what it most deeply concerns them
to know? The following case is related by Dr. Dewees
in his work on Diseases of Females: “We have known
a complaint communicated to the male by intercourse
with a woman labouring under <i>Pruritis</i>. It was very
similar to that which affected the female in its general
character. When this occurs with the married man,
much disturbance is sometimes created from a supposition
that the wife has been unfaithful, and the contrary.
Indeed, it has occurred in more instances than one,
within our own knowledge, where the woman has thought
herself the injured party; and in one case the recrimination
was mutual. In this instance, the friends of the
parties assembled to determine on the terms of separation,
when it was suggested, by one of those who happened
to be more rational than the rest, that before they
proceeded to such an extremity, their family physician
should be consulted. We were accordingly sent for.
After an attentive hearing of both parties, and an examination
of the parts, we were satisfied that there was not
the slightest ground for either to be charged with want
of fidelity, and we assured the parties that this was the
case, and were fortunate enough to cause all further proceedings
to be suspended.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r39'>39</a>. The author of these pages having resided many years
in France, where this preventive has been used with infallible
and invariable success, can vouch for its efficacy,
healthiness and certainty. While there, he was importuned
to take the agency for its disposal in the United
States. But aware of the extreme sensitiveness, verging
upon mawkishness, with which the agitation of a question
of this nature would be viewed; the misapprehension to
which it might give rise, and the difficulty of presenting
it to the consideration of the public, it was not without
some reluctance that he was induced to take the exclusive
agency for its sale in this country. The numerous testimonials,
however, of its efficacy, and the warm expressions
of gratitude and thankfulness he has received since
taking the agency, have convinced him that this invaluable
preventive has been appreciated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Its efficacy is beyond question, as in Europe, among the
higher classes especially, it is universally used, and of
late among all classes. Thousands of married persons
have for years used it with invariable success. Instances
are related by the author from whom we have liberally
quoted, exactly similar to hundreds which have come to
the knowledge of the writer of these pages. The principle
upon which it prevents conception, is to neutralize
the fecundating properties in semen, and it preserves and
conduces to the health of the female, by eradicating all
predisposition to sexual weakness, fluor albus, or whites,
the falling of the womb, &#38;c., and restores and maintains
that elasticity and firmness of the generative functions
(appertaining only to a young female) for many years.
The French, who are scrupulously observant of themselves
in these particulars, and who retain their health,
vivacity, and capacity to receive and impart enjoyment,
to a remarkable age, would not for worlds abstain from
the use of M. Desomeaux’s Preventive to Conception,
merely from its effects in preserving their youth to an old
age, and would not permit a sexual act to transpire without
its use. When used under these circumstances, the
directions are somewhat varied. It is well known that
the French always have intervals of three, four, or more
years, between the birth of children, depending upon
either the health of the wife, or inclination or judgment
of parents. In cases of malformation, deformity of pelvis,
low state of health, its use is indispensable. In obtaining
this celebrated preventive, it is advisable in all cases to
communicate directly with him, the sole agent of the
United States, for the disposal of “<i>M. Desomeaux’s Preventive
to Conception</i>.” The packages can be forwarded
to all parts of the United States. Letters must be postpaid,

a covering (used by the male), called a <i><span lang="fr">baudruche</span></i> (known
as the French Secret), is used with success, with the view
of preventing pregnancy. Its intention, however, and
for which, perhaps, it is specially adapted, is to obviate
the penalty incurred by prostitution, and thereby guard
against the contraction of syphilis. But as the object of
the author is not to facilitate, but, on the contrary, effectually
to prevent the degrading intercourse the consequences
of which are sought to be avoided, in adverting
to it therefore, he has only in view its adaptation to prevent
conception. If made of proper material and texture,
it can, to a certain extent, be relied upon. Deeming this
latter consideration of essential importance, and having
been applied to in regard to it, he has imported them
made of the only material of which they should be composed.

and approximation, than of accurate calculation.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f42'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r42'>42</a>. “Any young man who will carefully note and compare
his sensations, will become convinced, that temperance
positively forbids such indulgence, at any rate, more
than twice a week; and that he trifles with his constitution
who neglects the prohibition. How immeasurably
important that parents should communicate to their sons,
but especially to their daughters, facts like these! It
is true that much depends upon habit, as some individuals
can indulge even daily without apparently sustaining
any physical injury; but such a frequency may
not be compatible with the well-being of both parties,
and should therefore not be encouraged.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f43'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r43'>43</a>. The writer, under the circumstances just mentioned,
in the course of his practice as Professor of the Diseases
of Women, has been called upon to effect miscarriages,
and in all cases, it has proved perfectly safe,
recovery following in about three days. When necessary
to be attended to, the earlier the better, but in no case,
if properly effected, with ordinary care on the part of
the patient, is it attended with any danger. A skilful
and practised obstetrician will impart no pain.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r44'>44</a>. <i>Anodyne Clyster.</i>—A gill of new milk, or thin
starch, or the same quantity of any of the mucilaginous
substances composing Simple and Emollient Clysters,
which consist of milk and water in equal parts: flax-seed
tea; infusion of quince-seed; barley water; mucilage of
gum Arabic, or slippery elm; thin starch. From half a
pint to a pint of either of these should be administered a
little more than milk warm, with the addition of one or
two teaspoonfuls of laudanum, for adults. In general,
a patient will bear three times the quantity of laudanum
administered in this way, than would be a proper dose
when taken into the stomach: so that, when to procure rest,
twenty-five drops would be given in a draught, seventy-five
may be administered in a clyster, and the sickness,
and other ill consequences, which some persons complain
of after laudanum has been taken into the stomach, seldom
follow when administered by clyster.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f45'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r45'>45</a>. If faintness occurs from the loss of blood by flooding,
a little brandy, with two-thirds cold water, should be given
in frequent and small quantities at a time. Nothing so
speedily restores the strength in such cases.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f46'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r46'>46</a>. As in most cases the predisposition to miscarry arises
from a very weakened or diseased state of the uterus, or
general debility of the system, which is mostly caused by
one period of pregnancy followed by miscarriage, too
closely succeeding another with the same results, it is
obvious that the prevention of pregnancy by the use of
M. Desomeaux’s “<cite>Preventive of Pregnancy</cite>,” (treated
of in the preceding pages,) for about two years or so,
or until health and strength are restored, is the proper
remedy; thereby enabling the system to correct the predisposition,
by improving the tone and vigour of the
uterus. The writer can vouch that by the use of this
“Preventive,” many women who had before constantly
miscarried, at particular periods, entirely recovered, and
gave birth to full grown and healthy children, after trying
all other means without avail.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f47'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r47'>47</a>. Interdiction of marriage is not necessary, all that is
required is that <i>pregnancy should be prevented</i>; this,
thanks to M. Desomeaux’s discovery can be attained
by the use of his “Preventive to Pregnancy.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f48'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r48'>48</a>. This is true when it is a right presentation (the head),
or when the duration and severity of labor may not induce
convulsions.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f49'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r49'>49</a>. That barrenness, in most cases, arises from some defect
or obstruction, susceptible of cure, the fact, that those
who for a number of years have had no children, when
once becoming pregnant—the defect or obstruction being
eradicated—have children in close succession, may be
adduced as almost conclusive proof.</p>
